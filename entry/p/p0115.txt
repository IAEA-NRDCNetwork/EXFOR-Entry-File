ANALYSIS   These data have been expanded and corrected as         P0115002    7 
           follows: (1) additional bombardments have been         P0115002    8 
           performed, (2) the total (d,2n) cross-sections         P0115002    9 
            (i.e., for the isomer + ground state) have also been  P0115002   10 
           obtained, a procedure which required counting the      P0115002   11 
           7.2y Ba133 after all of the isomer had decayed, and    P0115002   12 
            (3) a re-evaluation of the Ba133m yields on the basis P0115002   13 
           of newer internal conversion coefficients which        P0115002   14 
           differ appreciably from those used in the earlier      P0115002   15 
           calculations.                                          P0115002   16

ANALYSIS   No additional work has been undertaken on the          P0115013    4 
           previous measurement. However, the cross sections      P0115013    5

           newer decay-scheme information. The corrected cross    P0115013    8 
           sections, which differ by 11% from those reported      P0115013    9 
           earlier, are shown.                                    P0115013   10
