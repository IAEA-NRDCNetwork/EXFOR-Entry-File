DETECTOR   Time projection chamber with working gas mixture       L0258  1   18 
           serving at the same time as reaction target.           L0258  1   19 
           Ionization electrons drift towards a double            L0258  1   20 
           parallel-grid avalanche multiplier, yielding charge    L0258  1   21 
           multiplication and light emission. Avalanche-induced   L0258  1   22 
           photons from N2 emission are collected, intensified    L0258  1   23 
           and recorded with a Charge Coupled Device (CCD)        L0258  1   24 
           camera, providing two-dimensional track images. The    L0258  1   25 
           event's time projection (third coordinate) and the     L0258  1   26 
           deposited energy are recorded by photomultipliers and  L0258  1   27 
           by the TPC charge-signal, respectively. Detector has   L0258  1   28 
           nearly 100 % efficiency and negligible background.     L0258  1   29 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Nearly monoenergetic gamma-rays were produced    L0258  1   30 
           by Compton backscattering of photons of the            L0258  1   31 
           free-electron laser. Beams of circularly polarized     L0258  1   32 
           gamma rays with energies between 9.1 and 10.7 MeV      L0258  1   33 
           were used with energy spreads of 300-350 keV and       L0258  1   34 
           on-target intensities of 2E+8 photons/sec.             L0258  1   35

ANALYSIS   From measured total width of 10.025 MeV state and      L0258  2    4 
           3 alpha particle decay width ratio, an upper limit on  L0258  2    5 
           3 alpha decay of Hoyle state was determined from       L0258  2    6 
           R-matrix theory, which gives relation of width and     L0258  2    7 
           penetrability of a state. Three alpha penetrability    L0258  2    8 
           ratios were calculated using Monte Carlo code with     L0258  2    9 
           WKB approximation.                                     L0258  2   10
