METHOD     (EXTB)                                                 L0251  1   28 
           Three physical processes were identified that could    L0251  1   29 
           lead to systematic errors. These  are  spontaneous     L0251  1   30 
           fission, thermal neutron fission in 235U and           L0251  1   31 
           attenuation of fragments in the oxide layer of the 238UL0251  1   32 
           foil. A calculation for both 238U and 232Th with       L0251  1   33 
           spontaneous fission half-lives of 1.02e16 y and        L0251  1   34 
           1.39e18 y would account for only 0.072% and 0.00053% ofL0251  1   35 
           the expected number of fission events. To estimate     L0251  1   36 
           thermal neutron fission in 235U, 93% enriched 235U foilL0251  1   37 
           was placed in the beam produced by a Cr target in a    L0251  1   38 
           manner identical to that of the depleted 238U foil. TheL0251  1   39 
           resulting track density did not vary by more than one  L0251  1   40 
           standard deviation from the results obtained with the  L0251  1   41 
           depleted 238U foil. To estimate attenuation of fission L0251  1   42 
           fragments in the black oxide layer, two separate runs  L0251  1   43 
           were made in gamma ray beams produced by the Cr and Ti L0251  1   44 
           targets with a uranium foil that had its oxide layer   L0251  1   45 
           removed. The results from these two runs did not       L0251  1   46 
           deviate from the other results by more than one        L0251  1   47 
           standard deviation.                                    L0251  1   48 
           state nuclear track detectors, the photoneutrons       L0251  1   49 
           from (gamma,n) and (gamma,f) reactions were detected   L0251  1   50 
           by 4pi long counter of  a Halpern type with  4 BF3     L0251  1   51 
           detectors immersed  in paraffin. The efficiency of the L0251  1   52 
           detector was determined by placing a 1.0Ci PuBe source L0251  1   53 
           and was calculated to be 2.15%.                        L0251  1   54 
DETECTOR   (TRD,BF3) The fission events are recorded with solid   L0251  1   55

           of the neutron capture target. To account for any      L0251  1   68 
           potential scattering of neutrons in the beam by the    L0251  1   69 
           fissile target, a copper foil of equal mass was  placedL0251  1   70 
           in the detector during the background measurements.    L0251  1   71
