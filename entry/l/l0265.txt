METHOD     The essential features of the experiment are the use   L0265  1   11 
           of high voltage x-ray to produce the disintegrations   L0265  1   12 
           and a boron-trifluoride filled proportional counter    L0265  1   13 
           to detect the resulting neutrons.                      L0265  1   14 
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The present day threshold values   L0265  1   15 
           are 1.66 MeV and 2.2 MeV for 9Be and 2H, respectively. L0265  1   16

ANALYSIS   Reaction thresholds were measured in the present       L0265  2    4 
           work: High voltage x-rays have been used to            L0265  2    5 
           redetermine the thresholds for the                     L0265  2    6 
           photodisintegration of beryllium and deuterium nuclei, L0265  2    7 
           giving 1.627+-0.010 MeV and 2.183+-0.012 MeV,          L0265  2    8 
           respectively. The cross section ratio was deduced by   L0265  2    9 
           comparing neutron counting rates 15 keV above the      L0265  2   10 
           reaction thresholds. Therefore, the beryllium cross    L0265  2   11 
           section energy was 1.642 MeV and deuterium cross       L0265  2   12 
           section energy is 2.198 MeV.                           L0265  2   13

ANALYSIS   For quantum energies ranging from 0 to 0.25 MeV above  L0265  3    4 
           threshold or 2.183-2.433 X-ray energy. With even less  L0265  3    5 
           precision it is possible to estimate the order of      L0265  3    6 
           magnitude of the total cross section: reasonable       L0265  3    7 
           guesses as to the effective number of quanta and the   L0265  3    8 
           sensitivity of neutron detection lead to a value of    L0265  3    9 
           about 10**(-28) cm2.                                   L0265  3   10
