SAMPLE     Al scattering target with thickness of 2.53 cm.        L0198  1   12 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Scattered photons were measured by four 60%     L0198  1   13 
           HPGe detectors which were on average of 12 cm from     L0198  1   14 
           the target, at a scattering angle of 120deg, with two  L0198  1   15 
           in the horizontal plane, and two in the vertical       L0198  1   16 
           plane. They were shielded with 2.5-cm Pb on the        L0198  1   17 
           sides, and Pb (0.55 cm) and Cu (0.4 cm) filters were   L0198  1   18 
           placed in front of the detectors to reduce the         L0198  1   19 
           intensity of low energy photons hitting the detector.  L0198  1   20 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) A circular polarized gamma-ray beam was produced L0198  1   21 
           by Compton backscattering of laser photons from        L0198  1   22 
           relativistic electrons in a storage ring. The levels   L0198  1   23 
           were simultaneously excited by NRF using the high-flux L0198  1   24 
           of 1E+8 photons/s circularly polarized                 L0198  1   25
