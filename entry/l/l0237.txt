FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility  L0237  1    9 
           at Duke University, generated circularly polarized     L0237  1   10 
           and monoenergetic photon beams.                        L0237  1   11 
SAMPLE     The natural In targets in the disk form with diameter  L0237  1   12 
           of 1 in.(2.54cm) with total mass of approximately 2 g. L0237  1   13 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Activated In foils were gamma counted with a    L0237  1   14 
           Canberra HPGe detector and standard data-acquisition   L0237  1   15 
           hardware and software.                                 L0237  1   16 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. In foils were      L0237  1   17 
           irradiated for 20 h at each energy                     L0237  1   18 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-              L0237  1   19 
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam        L0237  1   20 
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or     L0237  1   21 
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is      L0237  1   22 
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam        L0237  1   23 
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon    L0237  1   24 
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free- L0237  1   25 
           electron laser. Infrared photons with wavelength of    L0237  1   26 
           1070 nm were backscattered of relativistic electrons   L0237  1   27 
           circulating in a 1.2-GeV electron storage ring with    L0237  1   28 
           currents between 60 and 90 mA. The electron energy     L0237  1   29 
           was adjusted between 384 and 455 MeV and the current   L0237  1   30 
           in the wiggler electromagnets was changed to provide   L0237  1   31 
           the photon beam energies of interest.                  L0237  1   32
