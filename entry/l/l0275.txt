SAMPLE     Natural tantalum targets of 2.54 cm diameter and 0.12  L027500100015 
           mm thickness with mass of 1.2 g containing only 140    L027500100016 
           microg of 180mTa.                                      L027500100017 
METHOD     (ACTIV) De-excitation cross section of the isomeric-   L027500100018 
           state nuclide 180mTa has been measured with            L027500100019 
           mono-energetic photon beams in the 1.56 MeV to 3.70    L027500100020 
           MeV energy range. After irradiation for typically 20   L027500100021 
           h with photon fluxes ranging from 0.3*10**7            L027500100022 
           gamma/(cm2*s) to 3.2*10**7 gamma/(cm2*s), the 180mTa   L027500100023 
           de-excitation cross section was obtained from the      L027500100024 
           yield of the Kalpha1 and Kalpha2 X rays of 180mHf at   L027500100025 
           55.79 keV and 54.61 keV, respectively, produced after  L027500100026 
           electron capture on the unstable 180mTa ground state.  L027500100027 
           The tantalum disks were gamma-ray counted with a       L027500100028 
           planar HPGe detector. For this purpose the disk was    L027500100029 
           attached directly to the front face of the 30 mm       L027500100030 
           diameter detector. Its efficiency was measured in the  L027500100031 
           region of interest with a calibrated multi-isotope     L027500100032 
           gamma-ray source, including 241Am with X rays at       L027500100033 
           59.54 keV.                                             L027500100034 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainty assigned to the data include   L027500100035 
           the statistical uncertainties plus an estimated 25%    L027500100036 
           uncertainty in bremsstrahlung correction, except at    L027500100037 
           Egamma=1.8 MeV, where a 18% uncertainty was used.      L027500100038 
           The latter two uncertainties are estimates based on    L027500100039 
           the present single-electron and two-electron bunch     L027500100040 
           tests and past experience. All individual              L027500100041 
           uncertainties were added in quadrature.                L027500100042 
           (ERR-1,18.,25.) Bremsstrahlung correction.             L027500100043 
CORRECTION A sizable attenuation correction of 1.3 had to be      L027500100044 
           applied, using the X-ray attenuation factor. A small   L027500100045 
           correction was applied to account for the slightly     L027500100046 
           different electron beam currents used at some of the   L027500100047 
           energies. The bremsstrahlung correction.               L027500100048
