FACILITY   (SRING,1USATNL) Measurements were carried out at the   L017400100011 
           High Intensity Gamma- Ray Source (HIgS) facility       L017400100012 
           located on the campus of Duke University               L017400100013 
SAMPLE     (36-KR-86,ENR=0.994) The target was 1012 mg of         L017400100014 
           enriched Kr gas contained in a spherical stainless     L017400100015 
           steel cell                                             L017400100016 
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Emitted neutrons from the (g,n) reaction were  L017400100017 
           detected using a 4Pi assembly of 3He proportional      L017400100018 
           counters, fabricated into a single unit. The assembly  L017400100019 
           consists of 18 individual counters, arranged in two    L017400100020 
           concentric rings. Each counter was filled with 3He     L017400100021 
           gas at 6 atm pressure. The space around the counters   L017400100022 
           was stuffed with polyethelene that thermalizes the     L017400100023 
           emitted neutrons before they are captured (detected)   L017400100024 
           in the 3He counters.                                   L017400100025 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The facility has a 0.24-1.2 GeV storage ring     L017400100026 
           where quasi-monoenergetic gamma-beam is produced by    L017400100027 
           the intracavity Compton back-scattering of the free    L017400100028 
           electron laser photons from the electron bunches.      L017400100029
