SAMPLE     Cylindrical target chamber made of Sol-Gel coated      L0271  1   17 
           Pyrex glass 39.6 cm long and 2.9 cm in diameter was    L0271  1   18 
           connected to spherical pumping chamber 8.1 cm. The     L0271  1   19 
           spin-exchange optical pumping technique was used to    L0271  1   20 
           polarize 3He target. A small quantity of Rb and K was  L0271  1   21 
           placed in the pumping chamber, heated to 196 deg C. A  L0271  1   22 
           circularly polarized 794.8 nm laser light incident on  L0271  1   23 
           the pumping chamber polarized Rb atoms which in turn   L0271  1   24 
           transferred their polarization to 3He. The target was  L0271  1   25 
           filled with (6.5+-0.1) amg of 3He.                     L0271  1   26 
            (1 amg = 44.615 mol/m3)                               L0271  1   27 
           Polarization of the target was 33% for the initial run L0271  1   28 
           period and 22% for the final run period.               L0271  1   29 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Protons from the 3He photodisintegrations      L0271  1   30 
           were detected by 72 fully depleted silicon surface     L0271  1   31 
           barrier detectors. The detectors were placed at the    L0271  1   32 
           proton angles of 45, 70, 95, and 120 deg (18           L0271  1   33 
           detectors at each angle) along the target at a         L0271  1   34 
           distance of 10 cm from target axis.                    L0271  1   35 
           (SCIN) Two BC-501A liquid scintillator detectors were  L0271  1   36 
           used to detect neutrons from the deuteron              L0271  1   37

INC-SOURCE (LCS) Quasi-monochromatic linearly polarized gamma-ray L0271  1   45 
           beams were produced from laser Compton backscattering  L0271  1   46 
           of free-electron laser photons off relativistic        L0271  1   47 
           electrons. The resulting gamma-ray beam is nearly      L0271  1   48 
           mono-energetic and almost 100% circularly polarized.   L0271  1   49
