FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at HIgS facility  L0238  1    9 
           at Duke University, generated circularly polarized     L0238  1   10 
           and monoenergetic photon beams.                        L0238  1   11 
SAMPLE     (34-SE-80,ENR=0.9945) The selenium target consisted of L0238  1   12 
            2.99 g of enriched 80Se powder, encased in a plastic  L0238  1   13 
            cylinder. The volume containing the 80 Se powder was  L0238  1   14 
            20-mm diameter x 5-mm long.The front and back ends of L0238  1   15 
            the plastic cylinder were 1.5 mm thick each, and the  L0238  1   16 
            surrounding circular wall was 5.5 mm thick.           L0238  1   17 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Three liquid-scintillation detectors filled     L0238  1   18 
           with BC501-A fluid were placed around the target.      L0238  1   19 
           The front of each detector was covered with a 2.4 mm   L0238  1   20 
           thick lead disk to desensitize the scintillators to    L0238  1   21 
           the prompt gamma ray flash.                            L0238  1   22 
           Position of individual detectors with respect to       L0238  1   23 
           sample and gamma ray beam was as follows               L0238  1   24

           (SCIN) The number of photons incident on the target    L0238  1   29 
           was measured with the thin plastic scintillator paddle L0238  1   30 
           that was located upstream.                             L0238  1   31 
METHOD     (TOF,PSD) Energy of emitted neutrons were determined   L0238  1   32 
           using time-of-flight. Excellent pulse shape properties L0238  1   33 
           of BC501-A was used to identify neutrons. Gamma ray    L0238  1   34 
           peak position was used as internal time reference.     L0238  1   35 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) The HIgS facility produces a quasi-              L0238  1   36 
           monoenergetic Compton backscattered photon beam        L0238  1   37 
           tunable in wide energy range with either linear or     L0238  1   38 
           circular polarization. A high-flux photon beam is      L0238  1   39 
           created by colliding relativistic electron beam        L0238  1   40 
           bunches, circulating in a storage ring, with photon    L0238  1   41 
           pulses inside the high-power optical cavity of a free- L0238  1   42 
           electron laser. The 15.6-MeV gamma ray beam was        L0238  1   43 
           produced by Compton backscattering of FEL photons with L0238  1   44 
           wavelength 454.7 nm off 624-MeV electrons. The gamma   L0238  1   45 
           ray beam at the HIGS is pulsed with a bunch width of   L0238  1   46 
           300 ps FWHM and a period of 180 ns between pulses.     L0238  1   47 
           This time structure enables neutron energy             L0238  1   48 
           determinations by time-of-flight methods.              L0238  1   49 
ANALYSIS   Angle-integrated differential cross-section data were  L0238  1   50 
           integrated with respect to excitation energy. Due to   L0238  1   51 
           the 600-keV energy threshold, measured cross section   L0238  1   52 
           data were extrapolated from the maximum excitation     L0238  1   53 
           energy of the measurements to the theoretical maximum  L0238  1   54 
           excitation energy.                                     L0238  1   55
