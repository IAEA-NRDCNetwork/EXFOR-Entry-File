FACILITY   (VDG,1USAMIT) Experiment was conducted at the High     L016000100009 
           Voltage Research Laboratory at Massachusetts           L016000100010 
           Institute of Technology.                               L016000100011 
SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.998) Transmission detector sheet       L016000100012 
           consisted of five depleted uranium (DU) sheets with    L016000100013 
           dimensions of 20.32 cm x  20.32 cm and thickness of    L016000100014 
           0.8 mm. Behind the DU plates, 82.3 +- 0.5 g of Mn and  L016000100015 
           185.1 +- 0.8 g of 99.52% enriched 11B were also        L016000100016 
           positioned in the beam to serve as auxiliary flux      L016000100017 
           monitors. Total mass of DU plates was 3226.7 +- 28 g.  L016000100018 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two pairs of approximately 100% relative        L016000100019 
           efficiency high-purity germanium detectors were        L016000100020 
           positioned 27 cm from the intersection of the beam     L016000100021 
           center and the transmission detection sheet, at an     L016000100022 
           angle of 118deg relative to the centroid beam          L016000100023 
           direction.                                             L016000100024 
METHOD     (TRN,GSPEC) The assay target was used to down-scatter  L016000100025 
           incident photon beam to the energy of resonance.       L016000100026 
           The assay target consisting of combination of DU and PbL016000100027 
           was located directly downstream of the  collimator     L016000100028 
           opening. The areal densities of DU for different runs  L016000100029 
           varied form 0 g/cm2 (background run) to 8.47g/cm2.     L016000100030 
           The Pb densities varied from 79.85g/cm2 to 86.26g/cm2. L016000100031

INC-SOURCE (BRST) Bremstrahlung produced by electrons             L016000100033 
           accelerated to 2.60+-0.03 MeV in converter target      L016000100034 
           consisting of a 102 mu-m thick Au layer on a 1         L016000100035 
           cm-thick water-cooled Cu backing. The electron         L016000100036 
           current incident upon the converter was approximately  L016000100037 
           65 mu-A throughout the experiment.                     L016000100038 
ANALYSIS   The photon spectra that reached the transmission       L016000100039 
           detection sheet after emission from each of the assay  L016000100040 
           targets were calculated by Monte-Carlo method using    L016000100041 
           code MCNPX.                                            L016000100042
