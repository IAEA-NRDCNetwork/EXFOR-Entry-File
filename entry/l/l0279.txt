DETECTOR   (GEMUC,THRES) Short bombardments of silver, copper,    L0279  1   11 
           and polystyrene detectors result in activities         L0279  1   12 
           produced primarily by (gamma,n) processes:             L0279  1   13 
           Ag107(gamma,n) Ag106, 24 min (counting was started     L0279  1   14 
           after the 2.3-min activity of Ag108 had died out);     L0279  1   15 
           Cu63(gamma,n)Cu62 10.1 min; C12(gamma,n)C11, 20 min.   L0279  1   16 
METHOD     (ACTIV) After bombardment the foils were rolled into   L0279  1   17 
           cylinders having a diameter of 7/8 in., placed over    L0279  1   18 
           Eck and Krebs thin-walled glass Geiger counters, and   L0279  1   19 
           their activities compared. The consecutive             L0279  1   20 
           interchange of samples compensated for the different   L0279  1   21 
           counter efficiencies.                                  L0279  1   22 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curves were then taken for each sample   L0279  1   23 
           and the different product activities separated. The    L0279  1   24 
           irradiation time depends, of course, on the half-life  L0279  1   25 
           and the yield of the product activity, but it was in   L0279  1   26 
           general of the same order as the half-life. The        L0279  1   27 
           values of effective photon energy (W), as obtained     L0279  1   28 
           from the transition curves were used.                  L0279  1   29

ANALYSIS   A lower limit to the total integrated cross section    L0279  4    4 
           sigma int tot for photon absorption by the Zn nucleus  L0279  4    5 
           can be estimated. Adding the integrated cross          L0279  4    6 
           sections, for the (gamma,n), (gamma,2n),(gamma,p),     L0279  4    7 
            (gamma,pn), and (gamma,p2n) reactions, a              L0279  4    8 
           value of 1.2 MeV*barns is obtained. The relative       L0279  4    9 
           yields, but not W are known for the (gamma,3n),        L0279  4   10 
            (gamma,p3n), and (gamma,p4n) processes. By            L0279  4   11 
           estimating the corresponding effective photon energies L0279  4   12 
           from the number of ejected nucleons, an additional     L0279  4   13 
           contribution of about 0.2 MeV*barn is obtained. The    L0279  4   14 
           fact that not all of the observed reactions started    L0279  4   15 
           from the same Zn isotope should not greatly affect     L0279  4   16 
           this result since the excited nuclei were all of the   L0279  4   17 
           even-even type.                                        L0279  4   18
