FACILITY   (LASER,1USALRL) Petawatt laser facility. 260 J of      L0254  1   16 
           1.05 mu-m laser light, in a 450 fs long pulse, was     L0254  1   17 
           focused onto a solid gold target, after being          L0254  1   18 
           reflected from a plasma mirror. The focal spot size    L0254  1   19 
           was 20 mu-m, producing an average intensity of         L0254  1   20 
           greater than 10.E+20 W/cm2, corresponding to a         L0254  1   21 
           ponderomotive energy of 3 MeV. A lower intensity       L0254  1   22 
           prepulse of <100 mu-J was focused on the target 2 ns   L0254  1   23 
           prior to the main pulse. The prepulse created a        L0254  1   24 
           plasma at the target surface, which from a plasma      L0254  1   25 
           hydrodynamic calculation is expected to have           L0254  1   26 
           undergone a two-dimensional expansion with a rapidly   L0254  1   27 
           decreasing plasma density extending away from the      L0254  1   28 
           target. The density scale length is estimated to be    L0254  1   29 
           50 mu-m, in which the main laser pulse experiences     L0254  1   30 
           relativistic self-focusing or filamentation. The gold  L0254  1   31 
           target was mounted on a cylindrical copper sample      L0254  1   32 
           holder, which contained an additional quantity of      L0254  1   33 
           197Au (0.3 g) and 238U .                               L0254  1   34 
INC-SOURCE (BRST) The low energy portion of the electron spectrum L0254  1   35 
           resembles a Maxwellian with a 3 MeV mean energy. The   L0254  1   36 
           high energy tail extends up to 100 MeV.                L0254  1   37

ANALYSIS   The time-resolved gamma-ray information was used to    L0254  1   42 
           identify decay products from the photoinduced fission  L0254  1   43 
           of 238U. The nuclides were identified by their         L0254  1   44 
           gamma-ray line energies and half-lives include 87,88Kr,L0254  1   45

CORRECTION The direct contribution to the yield of a given nuclideL0254  1   48 
           by the fission process was obtained from the total     L0254  1   49 
           yield, after making corrections for contributions from L0254  1   50 
           other decay chains.                                    L0254  1   51
