           Photon energy resolution is typical for livermore      L005100100009 
            facility experiments.                                 L005100100010 
SAMPLE     The 5.55-mole helium gas sample was contained at a     L005100100011 
            pressure of 30.61 mpa (about 300 atm).                L005100100012

            detector.                                             L005100100014 
METHOD     (EXTB)                                                 L005100100015 
ANALYSIS   After the recorded neutron events were corrected for   L005100100016 
            pileup in the detector, the neutron backgrounds       L005100100017 
            (annihilation target removed) were substracted for    L005100100018 
            both the positron and electron measurements.          L005100100019 
           Because the energy spectrum of the annihilation-plus-  L005100100020 
            Bremsstrahlung radiation differs from that of purely  L005100100021 
            Bremsstrahlung photons, a measured correction was     L005100100022 
            applied to the ion-chamber (beam monitor) response to L005100100023 
            normalize the electron data to the positron data.     L005100100024 
           The normalized electron data then were substracted fromL005100100025 
            the positron data, leaving the neutron counts which   L005100100026 
            result only from the annihilation radiation.          L005100100027 
           The measured sample-blank data, normalized to equal    L005100100028 
            photon flux, were substracted from the target data to L005100100029 
            give the net target results.                          L005100100030 
           After a small correction for the neutron multiplicity  L005100100031 
            in each ring, the data were corrected for the energy- L005100100032 
            dependent efficiency of the neutron detector using theL005100100033 
            ring-ratio result for each energy.                    L005100100034 
           The data were converted to photoneutron cross sections L005100100035 
            by applying the measured ion-chamber response per     L005100100036 
            photon, the known number of target nuclei in the beam L005100100037 
            and a small correction for the photon attenuation in  L005100100038 
            the sample.                                           L005100100039 
           A multiplicity analysis of the number of neutrons      L005100100040 
            recordered in each beam burst allows the (gamma,n) andL005100100041 
            (gamma,2n) yields to be extracted simultaneously and  L005100100042 
            independently.                                        L005100100043 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR1) Statistical errors only.                   L005100100044 
           (DATA-ERR2) There are several possible sources of      L005100100045 
            systematic errors:                                    L005100100046 
            - uncertainty in the photon flux calibration: no      L005100100047 
              greater than 5% at 22 MeV, but rises to about 10%   L005100100048 
              at 45 MeV.                                          L005100100049 
            - uncertainty in the neutron-detector efficiency      L005100100050 
              >3% for neutrons of 2 MeV (E(gamma) about 23 MeV),  L005100100051 
              rising to about 5% for E(n) = 14 MeV, and, perhaps, L005100100052 
              to 8% for E(n) = 18 MeV (E(gamma) about 45 MeV).    L005100100053 
            - uncertaintiy arising from the Bremsstrahlung yield  L005100100054 
              substraction: never more than 2% of the yield, WHIC L005100100055 
              translates into about 10% of the cross section at   L005100100056 
              35 MeV.                                             L005100100057 
            - uncertainty arising from the sample-blank yield:    L005100100058 
              could be as much as 15% above 42 MeV.               L005100100059 
           The data points at 25.3, 26.3 MeV, and, perhaps, at    L005100100060 
            28.3 MeV, have systematic uncertainties as large as   L005100100061 
            15%.                                                  L005100100062 
COMMENT    Results agree with earlier monoenergetic-photon and    L005100100063 
            certain photoneutron time-of-flight (liquid-sample)   L005100100064 
            results at the lower energies, and consequently       L005100100065 
            disagree with the results of other experiments at     L005100100066 
            these energies. At the higher energies, however, the  L005100100067 
            present results are essentially in agreement with all L005100100068 
            previous results.                                     L005100100069
