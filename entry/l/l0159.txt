FACILITY   (ESTRG,1USATNL)Experiment was conducted using TUNL's   L015900100008 
           High-Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIgS) at the Duke     L015900100009 
           Free-Electron-Laser Laboratory                         L015900100010 
SAMPLE     232Th sample with purity of 99.9% and thickness of     L015900100011 
           0.1 cm. Diameter of sample was larger than the beam    L015900100012 
           diameter. Sample was inclined at 61.4 deg relative to  L015900100013 
           the incident beam and located at 52.5 m from the       L015900100014 
           collision point of electrons with FEL photons.         L015900100015 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays from the target were measured with   L015900100016 
           a HPGe detector array positioned about 4.8 m           L015900100017 
           downstream from the collimator. The array consists     L015900100018 
           of four HPGe detectors with 60% efficiency, positioned L015900100019 
           10 cm away from the center of the target and at an     L015900100020 
           angle of 90 deg relative to the photon beam. Two       L015900100021 
           detectors were located in the horizontal plane and two L015900100022 
           in the vertical plane.                                 L015900100023 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Monoenergetic photons, with high                 L015900100024 
           polarization and selectable energy, were produced at   L015900100025 
           the HIgS facility using intracavity backscattering of  L015900100026 
           free-electron-laser (FEL) photons from electrons in    L015900100027 
           the DFELL storage ring. Photon energy was changed      L015900100028 
           from 2 MeV to 4 MeV with resolution of 5 %. The        L015900100029 
           linear polarization of the beam was almost 100%.       L015900100030
