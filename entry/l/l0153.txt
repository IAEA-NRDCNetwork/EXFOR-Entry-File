FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAYAL) Experiment performed at 65 MeV Yale    L015300100008 
           University Electron Linear Accelerator.                L015300100009 
SAMPLE     Two set of samples containing deuterium were used.     L015300100010 
            1. Deuterated polyethylene (C-2H2), one with diameter L015300100011 
               of 12.7 cm and thickness of 2.06 cm, the second    L015300100012 
               with diameter 7.18 cm and thickness of 4.57 mm.    L015300100013 
            2. Heavy water (2H2-O) in a a thin plastic cylindricalL015300100014 
               bottle with 7.62 cm diameter and 12.70 cm high.    L015300100015 
           For background measurement, targets with light water   L015300100016 
           and standard polyethylene with identical dimensions    L015300100017 
           as deuterated targets were used.                       L015300100018 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Solenoid with length of 1.2m, inside           L015300100019 
           diameter of 7.5 cm and maximal field of 5000 Oersted   L015300100020 
           was used for neutron spin precession. After a flight   L015300100021 
           path of 26m, photoneutrons were scattered from         L015300100022 
           a polarization analyser (liquid helium or graphite).   L015300100023 
           (SCIN) Four Pilot B plastic scintillators each         L015300100024 
           coupled to 12.7 cm diam phototubes are used as         L015300100025 
           neutron detectors to observe left-right asymmetries    L015300100026 
           of neutrons scattered from the helium polarization     L015300100027 
           analyser. Most of the data are obtained using two      L015300100028 
           pilot-B plastic scintillators (12.70 cm diam x 15.24 cmL015300100029 
           thick) each coupled to an RCA 7046 photo-multiplier    L015300100030 
           tube placed in the reaction plane at lab angles of     L015300100031 
           +-130 deg and at a distance of 27.6 cm from the centre L015300100032 
           of the helium analyser. Other two neutron detectors    L015300100033 
           12.70 cm diam x 7.62 cm thick with pilot-B plastic     L015300100034 
           scintillators each coupled to an Amperex 58 AVP        L015300100035 
           photomultiplier tube were used either in an up-down    L015300100036 
           geometry or in a left-right geometry at lab angles     L015300100037 
           of +-70deg.                                            L015300100038 
METHOD     (LRASY) The polarization of the photo-neutrons is      L015300100039 
           determined by observing the asymmetry in their         L015300100040 
           scattering from a liquid-helium cryostat or a          L015300100041 
           graphite cylinder placed at the end of a 25 m flight   L015300100042 
           path.                                                  L015300100043 
           (TOF) Photoneutron energy was determined by time-of-   L015300100044 
           flight over flight path of 26 m.                       L015300100045 
INC-SOURCE (BRST) Electrons with energy of 65 MeV striked a 250   L015300100046 
           mu-m thick tungsten foil and produce bremsstrahlung    L015300100047 
           photons with a maximum energy of 65 MeV. The           L015300100048 
           electrons which pass through the foil were absorbed    L015300100049 
           in a 10.80 cm thick x 6.35 cm diam electrically        L015300100050 
           insulated aluminium cylinder. Maximum beam current     L015300100051 
           was 2 A with pulse duration of 10 ns and repetition    L015300100052 
           rate of 330 Hz.                                        L015300100053 
ANALYSIS   Polarisation was determined from left-right asymetry   L015300100054 
           after subtraction of background contribution determinedL015300100055 
           in measurement with light water and non-deuterated     L015300100056 
           polyethylene                                           L015300100057 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information given. Given uncertainties   L015300100058 
            are most probably statistical uncertainties           L015300100059 
CORRECTION Corrected for target scattering effects, correction    L015300100060 
           amounts to 10% at 15 MeV neutron energy and to 20%     L015300100061 
           at the lowest energy.                                  L015300100062
