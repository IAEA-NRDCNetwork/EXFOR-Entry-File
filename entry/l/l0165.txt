DETECTOR   Time Projection Chamber with optical readout was used  L016500100010 
           to detect alpha particles, produced in reactions       L016500100011 
           with carbon nuclei in operating gas CO2. All outgoing  L016500100012 
           particles from photodissociation are fully determined  L016500100013 
           by their tracks recorded in three dimensions and all   L016500100014 
           relevant kinematical variables are measured.           L016500100015

INC-SOURCE (LCS) Nearly monoenergetic gamma ray beams were        L016500100017 
            produced by means of Compton backscattering inside    L016500100018 
            the optical cavity of a storage-ring-based            L016500100019 
            free-electron laser. Circularly polarized photons     L016500100020 
            were produced either with high ( dE/E = 0.9 - 1.6 %), L016500100021 
            or low  (dE/E = 1.9 - 2.3 %) energy resolution.       L016500100022
