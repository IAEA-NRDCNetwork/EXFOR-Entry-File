           19F(p,gamma) is a convenient but inexact designation   L0270  1   11 
           for the gamma-rays from fluorine bombarded with        L0270  1   12 
           protons, since it has been shown that most of the      L0270  1   13 
           high energy rays are emitted from an excited state of  L0270  1   14 
           16O derived from (20Ne)* by emission of an alpha       L0270  1   15 
           particle. The energy of the gamma-rays has been        L0270  1   16 
           measured to be 6.3 MeV and the character of the        L0270  1   17

SAMPLE     The first film was gray, and was assumed to be U308,   L0270  2    4 
           while the second was black, assumed to be UO2. The     L0270  2    5 
           weight of the first film was 4.06 mg, giving N = 0.87x L0270  2    6 
           10**19. The second, black, film (UO2) weighed 5.75 mg, L0270  2    7 
           giving 1.27X10**19 atoms from the weight.              L0270  2    8 
METHOD     (REC) The cross section for the photo-fission process  L0270  2    9 
           was measured by using a uranium film thin enough so    L0270  2   10 
           that every fission process could be observed in the    L0270  2   11 
           ionization chamber. Since each fission produces a      L0270  2   12 
           pair of recoil atoms having roughly the same mass,     L0270  2   13 
           one of the particles will be in a direction to be      L0270  2   14 
           recorded by the ionization, while the other will be    L0270  2   15 
           absorbed in the backing plate on which the uranium is  L0270  2   16 
           deposited. The evaporated films we used contained      L0270  2   17 
           approximately 1 mg/cm2, which is roughly 1/4 cm air    L0270  2   18 
           equivalent in stopping power. Fifteen runs were taken  L0270  2   19 
           in the determination of the fission rate per proton    L0270  2   20 
           current. Two uranium films were used, the proton       L0270  2   21 
           energy and current were varied as well as the          L0270  2   22 
           distance of the uranium to the target. In a sample     L0270  2   23 
           run, 41 fissions were observed in 295 seconds from a   L0270  2   24 
           uranium film containing 1.22x10**19 atoms placed so    L0270  2   25 
           that 1/4*pi*r**2 was 0.0134 cm2 when the CaF2 target   L0270  2   26 
           was bombarded with 0.91 microa of 3.0-MeV protons.     L0270  2   27

SAMPLE     Thick target of uranium and thorium. The thorium used  L0270  3    4 
           was spectroscopically free of uranium, and the         L0270  3    5 
           uranium had less than a few percent of thorium         L0270  3    6

           obtained by comparing the fission yields from thick    L0270  3   11 
           targets of uranium and thorium. In each case the same  L0270  3   12 
           exposed area of freshly sandpapered metal was used.    L0270  3   13
