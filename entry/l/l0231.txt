DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The samples were counted with Victoreen IB85   L0231  1   13 
           cylindrical Geiger counters.                           L0231  1   14 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The samples were irradiated in the betatron    L0231  1   15 
           beam with the cylindrical axis parallel to the beam.   L0231  1   16 
           Each sample was given a definite irradiation dose as   L0231  1   17 
           measured by an ionization chamber whose output was     L0231  1   18 
           integrated. The time of irradiation for each sample    L0231  1   19 
           was carefully measured.                                L0231  1   20

SAMPLE     For the oxygen activation curve cylindrical samples    L0231  3    4 
           of boric acid (H2B407) were used. These were formed    L0231  3    5

           under a pressure of about 7 ton/in. The cylinders      L0231  3    7 
           were about 5 cm long, 2.2-cm inside and 4.0-cm         L0231  3    8
