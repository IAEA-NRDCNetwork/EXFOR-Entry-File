DETECTOR   (HPGE) A high-purity germanium gamma-ray spectrometer. L028600100019 
SAMPLE     The target crucible had a depression drilled on the    L028600100020 
           face to house approximately 50.9 mg of gallium oxide   L028600100021 
           powder, or 60 mg for the compressed pellet. Kapton     L028600100022 
           tape held the powder in place. Then, the remaining     L028600100023 
           two foils were stacked atop this so as to receive a    L028600100024 
           nearly identical bremsstrahlung flux. The vanadium     L028600100025 
           foil was 100 microm thick while the nickel foil was    L028600100026 
           10 microm thick. The stack was placed 1 cm beyond the  L028600100027 
           radiator on the beam axis.                             L028600100028 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Post-irradiation and cooling, the target was   L028600100029 
           transported to a gamma-ray spectrometer to analyze     L028600100030 
           the samples individually. The JLab Radiation Control   L028600100031 
           Department performed a series of HPGe gamma            L028600100032 
           spectroscopy measurements on the foils in order to     L028600100033 
           estimate activation. The HPGe detector has a 23%       L028600100034 
           relative efficiency for 60Co, a beryllium window with  L028600100035 
           a thickness of 57 mm, and a 49-mm active diameter.     L028600100036 
           Calibrations for the various foils were determined     L028600100037 
           via Canberra In-situ Object Counting System Software   L028600100038

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties in this paper regarding the  L028600100042 
           bremsstrahlung weighted cross section of the           L028600100043 
           58Ni(g,n)57Ni cross section were not propagated. The   L028600100044 
           reason for this lies in the normalization via the      L028600100045 
           photon flux. The systematic errors from this flux are  L028600100046 
           calculated the same. Then, as we normalize to that     L028600100047 
           flux [i.e., take the ratios], errors stemming from     L028600100048 
           this largely cancel and do not contribute              L028600100049 
           substantially to the errors reported. Furthermore,     L028600100050 
           note that the random statistical uncertainties of the  L028600100051 
           simulations are very small in comparison to the        L028600100052
