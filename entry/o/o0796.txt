           Reference data for Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction at proton    O0796  1   14 
           energy at 1.985 MeV. The data were used to determine   O0796  1   15 
           number of Li-7 nuclei in used targets.                 O0796  1   16

SAMPLE     Circular targets of Li-F of 2 mm diameter, evaporated  O0796  1   18 
           on Al and Pt foils.  A liquid nitrogen cold cryofinger O0796  1   19 
           is placed close to the target area to protect the      O0796  1   20 
           target surface from contamination.  The vacuum in the  O0796  1   21 
           chamber was 8.E-7 Torr.                                O0796  1   22 
METHOD     (EXTB) A deutron beam (D2+) was raster scanned over a  O0796  1   23 
           rectangle of 7 mm X 6 mm.  The purpose of the scan is  O0796  1   24 
           to obtain a beam of uniform areal density.             O0796  1   25
