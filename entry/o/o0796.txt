           Reference data for Li-7(P,N)Be-7 reaction at proton    O079600100014 
           energy at 1.985 MeV.  The data were used to determine  O079600100015 
           number of Li-7 nuclei in used targets.                 O079600100016

SAMPLE     Circular targets of Li-F of 2 mm diameter, evaporated  O079600100018 
           on Al and Pt foils.  A liquid nitrogen cold cryofinger O079600100019 
           is placed close to the target area to protect the      O079600100020 
           target surface from contamination.  The vacuum in the  O079600100021 
           chamber was 8.E-7 Torr.                                O079600100022 
METHOD     (EXTB) A deutron beam (D2+) was raster scanned over a  O079600100023 
           rectangle of 7 mm X 6 mm.  The purpose of the scan is  O079600100024 
           to obtain a beam of uniform areal density.             O079600100025

           average of the two aluminum-backed targets believed to O079600200005 
           be free from backscattering loss.                      O079600200006
