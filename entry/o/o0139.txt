CRITIQUE   The analyzing power for target nuclei has been shown asO0139  1    9 
           a  function  of  the  channel energy which is the totalO0139  1   10 
           kinetic c.m.  energy in the  final  channel.   But  theO0139  1   11 
           authors  did  not  report  the  method to calculate theO0139  1   12 
           channel energy if they know alpha particle energy only.O0139  1   13

COMMENT    * by Compiler*  Authors data for channel energy have   O0139  1   15 
           been recalculated by compiler by using the formulae -  O0139  1   16 
           E(channel)= E(alpha)*(A+1)/(A-3)                       O0139  1   17 
           This hypothesis is likelihood because the authors      O0139  1   18 
           described their data as quasi-free Scattering Model.   O0139  1   19
