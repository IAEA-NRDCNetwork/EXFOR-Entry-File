INC-SOURCE The primary 120 MeV alpha beam was directed onto a 7   O2369  1   12 
           micron thick CD2 target, where it initiated            O2369  1   13 
           alpha-deuteron elastic scattering. The scattered       O2369  1   14 
           alpha beam was used in the experiment.                 O2369  1   15 
SAMPLE     5mm thick thick Si detector were used as target        O2369  1   16 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR) Measuring telescope: 100 micron thick    O2369  1   17 
           transmission detector and a 5 mm thick stopping        O2369  1   18 
           detector, the latter acted also as target for the      O2369  1   19 
           experiment                                             O2369  1   20

           measurement of the recoiling deuterons                 O2369  1   23 
METHOD     (EXTB,REC,SITA,COINC,EDE,ASSOP) Alpha elastic          O2369  1   24 
           scattering on deuteron was used to vary the energy of  O2369  1   25 
           the alpha particles. Nuclear reaction probabilities    O2369  1   26 
           in Si were then measured by coincidence detection of   O2369  1   27 
           alpha-deuteron elastic scattering events. Events in    O2369  1   28 
           the thick Si detector of the measuring telescope were  O2369  1   29 
           accepted, if a fast coincidence between its            O2369  1   30 
           transmission detector, and both detectors of the       O2369  1   31 
           recoil telescope was found. Pulse heights, timing      O2369  1   32 
           data, and pileup flags were recorded in event mode on  O2369  1   33 
           magnetic tape.                                         O2369  1   34 
ANALYSIS   Events were accepted for analysis when the recoil      O2369  1   35 
           telescope identified a deuteron of the correct energy  O2369  1   36 
           and the measuring telescope's transmission detector    O2369  1   37 
           recorded the energy loss expected for the alpha        O2369  1   38 
           particle. The reaction probabilities were then         O2369  1   39 
           obtained from the spectrum of the thick, stopping      O2369  1   40 
           detector of the measuring telescope.                   O2369  1   41 
           Events associated with nuclear reactions in the Si of  O2369  1   42 
           the detector register with less energy than the        O2369  1   43 
           bombarding energy of the alpha particle, thus in the   O2369  1   44 
           spectrum they show up below the peak due to stopping   O2369  1   45 
           via normal electromagnetic ionization processes. The   O2369  1   46 
           reaction probability thus can be determined as the     O2369  1   47 
           ratio of reaction events to all events (reaction +     O2369  1   48 
           normal stopping). The cross section was then           O2369  1   49 
           determined by fitting the reaction probabilities via   O2369  1   50 
           Eq. 1 of Ref., and found to be 1147 +/-52 mb. To this  O2369  1   51 
           value, an estimated contribution of 23 +/- 18 mb was   O2369  1   52 
           added, due to undetected inelastic scattering events   O2369  1   53 
           leading to the first excited state.                    O2369  1   54
