SAMPLE     The target assembly usually consisted of three target  O0413  1   11 
           foils. The middle foil was used for analysis while the O0413  1   12 
           outer foils compensated for the loss of recoils from   O0413  1   13 
           the targets.                                           O0413  1   14 
           The target stack was surrounded on either side by      O0413  1   15 
           three 0.001-in. thick aluminum monitor foils.          O0413  1   16 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The irradiation times had durations of 15-30   O0413  1   17 
           minutes.                                               O0413  1   18
