FACILITY   (ISOCY,2GERKFK) 3 muA deuteron beam of 52 MeV and 2.5  O246600100008 
           mm diameter incident on an internal target.            O246600100009 
METHOD     (INTB,BCINT) Beam current was registered by a          O246600100010 
           calibrated current-to-frequency converter. It was      O246600100011 
           corrected for the effect of deuterons absorption in    O246600100012 
           the steel target entrance wall assuming that only (85  O246600100013 
           +/- 5) % of the beam deuterons have reached the        O246600100014 
           lithium.                                               O246600100015 
SAMPLE     Metallic natural lithium of 21.8 mm thickness was      O246600100016 
           enclosed in a stainless steel container (the drawing   O246600100017 
           of the target is available in reference). The          O246600100018 
           upstream 1.1 mm thick side of container takes away 12  O246600100019 
           MeV. Target was positioned inside the cyclotron        O246600100020 
           magnet gap and was cooled by water. A separate         O246600100021 
           measurement with empty steel container was made to     O246600100022 
           subtract the neutron background.                       O246600100023

METHOD     (ACTIV) The tritium in the irradiated lithium target   O246600200005 
           was measured by releasing it from the target at        O246600200006 
           several hundred degrees Celsius within a quartz tube   O246600200007 
           through which a gas stream of 95% Ar + 5% H2 was       O246600200008 
           flowing at 50 ml/min. The gas was subsequently         O246600200009 
           oxidized in passing through a CuO bed. The resulting   O246600200010 
           H2O+HTO gas was absorbed in a molecular sieve. The     O246600200011 
           molecular sieve was periodically changed and eluted    O246600200012 
           with water.                                            O246600200013 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The tritiated water was analyzed for the        O246600200014 
           amount of tritium in an automated liquid               O246600200015 
           scintillation system Beckman Instruments LS 6000TA.    O246600200016 
CORRECTION The measured data were corrected for the H-3 decay     O246600200017 
           and for the neutron background produced in the steel   O246600200018 
           container wall of the Li target.                       O246600200019 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The 7% uncertainty derives from the         O246600200020 
           scatter (5%) of H-3 measurements with two targets and  O246600200021

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The Be-7 yield was determined by         O246600300005 
           measuring the 478 keV g-ray line from the irradiated   O246600300006 
           target with a g-ray spectrometer. It was done after a  O246600300007 
           cooling time of about 100 days, but prior to           O246600300008 
           destroying the target for the tritium measurement.     O246600300009 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma spectrometer was positioned at        O246600300010 
           distance 65 cm from irradiated sample and was          O246600300011 
           protected by a lead collimator in its front to         O246600300012 
           reduce the counting efficiency. Spectrometer was       O246600300013 
           calibrated with Eu-152 g-ray source.                   O246600300014 
CORRECTION The measured data were corrected for decay and for     O246600300015 
           the neutron background produced in the steel target    O246600300016 
           wall, as well as for the gamma ray absorption in the   O246600300017

           scatter of several Be-7 and calibration measurements   O246600300020 
           and the uncertainties of the corrections.              O246600300021
