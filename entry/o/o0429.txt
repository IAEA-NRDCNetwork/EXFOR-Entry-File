SAMPLE     The targets consisted of plastic scintillator disks    O042900100012 
           1/8 inch thick from which the C-11 gas loss is         O042900100013 
           negligible.                                            O042900100014 
           In the first experiment the diameter was 1 1/2 inch andO042900100015 
           in the later experiments 3/4 inch the carbon content ofO042900100016 
           the scintillators was taken to be 92% and, as is       O042900100017 
           customary, the cross sections were calculated on the   O042900100018 
           basis of the total carbon content of the targets, not  O042900100019 
           just the C-12 content.                                 O042900100020

           A 100-mu thick Ilford G-5 emulsion was mounted on the  O042900100022 
           upstream side of each scintillator. The emulsions were O042900100023 
           perpendicular to the beam so that the plunging track   O042900100024 
           method was used in scanning. In the later experiments  O042900100025 
           pellicules were used instead of glass backed emulsions.O042900100026
