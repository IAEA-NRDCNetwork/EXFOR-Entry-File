CORRECTION The main contributions to the uncertainties are        O2179  1   41 
           attributable to uncertainties of the target thickness, O2179  1   42 
           attenuation of the beam intensity in the target,       O2179  1   43 
           fission events lost on the pipe and the detection      O2179  1   44 
           efficiency of the TWIN chamber. The largest correctionsO2179  1   45 
           are attributable to the attenuation of the beam        O2179  1   46 
           intensity in the target considering the attenuation to O2179  1   47 
           half the target (values obtained for the energies 370, O2179  1   48
