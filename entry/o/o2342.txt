SAMPLE     Makrofol-Bismuth-Makrofol sandwiched targets were used O2342  1   12 
           with thicknesses of 90-130 ug/cm2. The bismuth layer   O2342  1   13 
           was deposited by vacuum evaporation on one of the      O2342  1   14 
           Makrofol foils, then it was covered by an other        O2342  1   15 
           Makrofol layer. Finally, the targets were packed       O2342  1   16 
           in vacuum-sealed plastic bags.                         O2342  1   17 
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol track detectors of size 40x30x0.2 mm3   O2342  1   18 
METHOD     (INTB,SITA) The sandwiched targets were irradiated by  O2342  1   19 
           alpha beams with normal incidence. After the           O2342  1   20 
           irradiation, the targets were dissolved by nitrate     O2342  1   21 
           acid, and the Makrofol detectors were etched in two    O2342  1   22 
           steps in a 20% NaOH solution at 60 degrees of          O2342  1   23 
           Celsius. The etching steps were 25 and 75 mins long,   O2342  1   24 
           respectively. After each etching step, the detectors   O2342  1   25 
           were rinsed with water and alcohol, then evaluated.    O2342  1   26 
           The evaluation was done by analyzing the tracks under  O2342  1   27 
           optical microscope, and by scanning the targets.       O2342  1   28
