SAMPLE     The target assembly consisted of several natural       O0615  1   20 
           uranium targets 1.2 mg/cm2 thick, each being sandwichedO0615  1   21 
           between 4.2 mg/cm2 aluminum catcher foils to stop the  O0615  1   22 
           fission products and to degrade the proton beam energy.O0615  1   23 
           The targets were prepared by depositing a solution     O0615  1   24 
           of uranium acetate on aluminum backings.               O0615  1   25
