SAMPLE     Two 95% enriched tellurium-123 dioxide targets were    O1332  1    8 
           each of 320 mg/cm2 thickness on 0.3 mm thick platinum  O1332  1    9 
           backing.  One target was freshly made and the other wasO1332  1   10 
           used for production of iodine for two years.           O1332  1   11 
           Tellurium targets were prepared by smelting of the     O1332  1   12 
           tellurium dioxide on a platinum plate.  The target     O1332  1   13 
           activity after irradiation belongs mainly to platinum  O1332  1   14 
           backing and isomer 123m-Te (t1/2 = 119.7 days).        O1332  1   15 
           Activation of the platinum plate is mostly conditioned O1332  1   16 
           by the activity of 196-Au (t1/2 = 6.18 days).  This    O1332  1   17 
           part of the target activity can be excluded by cooling O1332  1   18 
           for about two weeks or by change of the platinum plate.O1332  1   19

METHOD     (EXTB) The targets were irradiated two (new target)    O1332  1   21

COMMENT    -By compiler.  Isomer state of Te-123 could not be     O1332  2    5 
           produced due to radioactive decay of I-123.            O1332  2    6 
           By authors. 1. The "DATA" is the 123m-Te yield averagedO1332  2    7 
           with weights from MISC1 and MISC2.                     O1332  2    8 
           2.  The main gamma line of 123m-Te is of the same      O1332  2    9 
           energy of 159 KeV as of the iodine one.  Therefore     O1332  2   10 
           gamma measurements of the 123m-Te activity were carriedO1332  2   11 
           out two weeks after the end of bombardment when the    O1332  2   12 
           rest of iodine remaining after it's extraction has     O1332  2   13 
           completely decayed.                                    O1332  2   14
