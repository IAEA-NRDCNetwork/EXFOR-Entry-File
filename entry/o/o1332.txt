SAMPLE     Two 95% enriched tellurium-123 dioxide targets were    O133200100008 
           each of 320 mg/cm2 thickness on 0.3 mm thick platinum  O133200100009 
           backing.  One target was freshly made and the other wasO133200100010 
           used for production of iodine for two years.           O133200100011 
           Tellurium targets were prepared by smelting of the     O133200100012 
           tellurium dioxide on a platinum plate.  The target     O133200100013 
           activity after irradiation belongs mainly to platinum  O133200100014 
           backing and isomer 123m-Te (t1/2 = 119.7 days).        O133200100015 
           Activation of the platinum plate is mostly conditioned O133200100016 
           by the activity of 196-Au (t1/2 = 6.18 days).  This    O133200100017 
           part of the target activity can be excluded by cooling O133200100018 
           for about two weeks or by change of the platinum plate.O133200100019

METHOD     (EXTB) The targets were irradiated two (new target)    O133200100021

COMMENT    -By compiler.  Isomer state of Te-123 could not be     O133200200005

           By authors. 1. The "DATA" is the 123m-Te yield averagedO133200200007

           2.  The main gamma line of 123m-Te is of the same      O133200200009 
           energy of 159 KeV as of the iodine one.  Therefore     O133200200010 
           gamma measurements of the 123m-Te activity were carriedO133200200011 
           out two weeks after the end of bombardment when the    O133200200012 
           rest of iodine remaining after it's extraction has     O133200200013
