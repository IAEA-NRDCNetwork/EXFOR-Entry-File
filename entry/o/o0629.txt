COMMENT    -By Authors- The interactions resulted in 2 short-     O062900100038 
           range products are most likely due to non-fission      O062900100039 
           reaction mechanisms, probably fragmentation. An upper  O062900100040 
           limit of the fission cross section was estimated with  O062900100041 
           the use of product range distributions.                O062900100042
