SAMPLE     An isotopically enriched Xe-124 target was used.       O166600100008 
           The experimental target system was made of copper      O166600100009 
           coated by a thin layer of nickel. two molybdenum foils,O166600100010 
           cooled by a compressed flux of helium gas, were set    O166600100011 
           between the target and beam line.                      O166600100012

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3BZLIPE) The Cyclone-30 cyclotron installed at  O166600100014 
            IPEN.                                                 O166600100015 
METHOD     (BCINT) All irradiations were carried out at a beam    O166600100016 
           current ranging from 10 to 30 muA between 20 and 40 minO166600100017 
           given an average integrated current at the target of   O166600100018 
COMMENT    *By authors*.After EOB, the target was allowed a       O166600100019 
           cooling time for the Cs-123 to decay to Xe-123 and     O166600100020 
           I-123.                                                 O166600100021 
           The recovery of high-purity I-123 adsorbed on the wallsO166600100022 
           of the target chamber was performed by washing with    O166600100023 
           water. The effects of the length of time that the waterO166600100024 
           remained inside the target and the heating temperature O166600100025 
           were studied. this procedure was made in order to      O166600100026 
           improve the removing of the I-123 from the target wall,O166600100027 
           thereby decreasing product losses.                     O166600100028 
ADD-RES     The experimental I-123 yield was determined as a      O166600100029 
           function of the decay time after the EOB and as a      O166600100030 
           function of the temperature target chamber to remove   O166600100031 
           I-123 from the walls and as a function the gas Xe-124  O166600100032

COMMENT    *By authors*.The Xe-124 pressure was 1.8*10E+3 hPa     O166600200004 
           and the decay time after EOB was fixed at 7 Hr. The    O166600200005 
           target heating time was fixed at 10 min at 65C-degree. O166600200006
