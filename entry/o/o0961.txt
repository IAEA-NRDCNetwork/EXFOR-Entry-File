SAMPLE     85-Rb-Cl powder, isotopic abundance of Rb-85 is 99.4%, O096100100014 
           was used. A thin copper foil, 25-mum,was used as the   O096100100015 
           backing. The diameter of this foil depended on the     O096100100016 
           requirement of the irradiation facility, 13-20 mm.     O096100100017 
           A suspension of very fine rubidium chloride in water-  O096100100018 
           free toluene was obtained by mixing and stirring.      O096100100019 
           To avoid contamination, the surface of each sample was O096100100020 
           covered with a 10-mum thick Al-foil.                   O096100100021 
ADD-RES    (TTY-C).From the measured cross section data the yield O096100100022 
           for production of Sr-83 could be calculated. This      O096100100023 
           integral yield was verified by irradiation of thick    O096100100024 
           targets. The estimated total error in the thick target O096100100025 
           yield determination was about 10%.                     O096100100026
