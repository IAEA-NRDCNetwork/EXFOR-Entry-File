           section of 181-Ta for protons in the energy range 200- O133100100031 
           1000 MeV the following assumptions were used:          O133100100032 
           1.  Fission fragments leaving tantalum and lead targetsO133100100033 
           have the same registration properties.                 O133100100034 
           2.   Kinematic characteristics of fission fragments areO133100100035 
           such that a magnitude of ratio of the measured number  O133100100036 
           of fission fragments to their total number emitted in aO133100100037 
           total solid angle.  Is energy-independent in the       O133100100038 
           studied energy interval.                               O133100100039 
           3.  The contribution to the total number of counts fromO133100100040 
           the nuclear fragments arising in other processes is    O133100100041 
           small in this energy range and can be taken into       O133100100042 
           account by a small correction.                         O133100100043 
           4.   The value of this correction can be estimated fromO133100100044 
           results obtained for lighter targets (we used cadmium) O133100100045 
           where the process of fission can be neglected in       O133100100046
