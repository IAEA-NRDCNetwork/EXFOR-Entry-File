COMMENT    *By authors. In experimental setup used in Stuttgart   O105400100013 
           the target was placed at 90-degree to the beam axis.   O105400100014 
           Its backing was cooled directly with water during the  O105400100015 
           whole experiments. The detector were placed on a       O105400100016 
           rotating table at distances between 10 and 20-cm front O105400100017 
           the target.                                            O105400100018 
           In  experimental setup used in Athens the target was   O105400100019 
           placed at 20-degree with respect to the beam axis.     O105400100020 
           The distance between the target-center and the         O105400100021 
           detector-front was 12-cm. The detector was placed      O105400100022 
           on a goniometrical table that could rotate around the  O105400100023 
           target with an accuracy better than 1-degree. In order O105400100024 
           to measure gamma angular distributions at each beam    O105400100025 
           energy, gamma-singles spectra were taken at six angles O105400100026 
           with the respect to the beam. The target backing was   O105400100027 
           cooled with air during all measurements.               O105400100028 
           As in case of the measurements in Stuttgart, backgroundO105400100029 
           spectra were also measured, in order to investigate    O105400100030 
           possible yield contributions from the backing material.O105400100031 
           In both the Stuttgart and Athens experiments, the      O105400100032 
           absolute efficiency data were checked for uncertaintiesO105400100033 
           due to coincident summing.                             O105400100034

SAMPLE     The target material was 99.84% enriched in Sr-88,      O105400100038 
           this was produced by evaporating Sr-88(NO3)2 powder on O105400100039 
           a 0.4-mm thick tantalum backing. The amount of Sr-88 inO105400100040 
           the target was determined by means of an XRF analysis  O105400100041 
           before all measurements. It was also checked at the endO105400100042 
           of the Stuttgart measurements as well as at the end of O105400100043 
           the Athens runs. The thickness of Sr-88 in the target  O105400100044 
           before any measurement was 168+-7-mug/cm**2 and the    O105400100045 
           material loss was found to be less than 3%. This       O105400100046 
           thickness corresponds approximately 12 and 8-KeV at    O105400100047 
           beam energies of 2 and 4-MeV, respectively. These      O105400100048 
           values were derived using the SRIM code and assuming   O105400100049 
           that the target consists of Sr-88 only. However,       O105400100050 
           the thickness of the target is defined by its          O105400100051 
           stoichiometry that was determined at the end of the    O105400100052 
           measurements by performing a nuclear reaction analysis.O105400100053 
           The measurements were necessary to determine correctly O105400100054 
           the proton stopping powers.  The measurements were     O105400100055 
           performed using a single-charged H2 beam of 1.1-MeV    O105400100056 
           energy that was delivered by the tandem accelerator    O105400100057 
           of Athens.                                             O105400100058 
           The final amount of Sr-88 in the target, according to  O105400100059 
           the XRF analyses, did not differ practically from that O105400100060 
           in the beginning of the measurements allows to         O105400100061 
           calculate the maximum total target thickness by varyingO105400100062 
           the ratio of the amount of the Sr-88(NO3)2 to the      O105400100063 
            Sr-88(OH)2 phase. The maximum thickness obtained this O105400100064 
           way is 405 mug/cm**2, that corresponds to 44 and 28-KeVO105400100065 
           at 2 and 4-MeV, respectivily. This thickness is derivedO105400100066 
           if the target is comprised of the Sr-88(NO3)2 phase    O105400100067 
           only. Even in such an extreme case the uncertainty     O105400100068 
           entering the determination of the corresponding        O105400100069 
           effective energies is less than 0.5%.                  O105400100070
