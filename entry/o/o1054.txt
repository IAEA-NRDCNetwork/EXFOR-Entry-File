SAMPLE     The target material was 99.84% enriched in Sr-88,      O1054  1   13 
           this was produced by evaporating Sr-88(NO3)2 powder on O1054  1   14 
           a 0.4-mm thick tantalum backing. The amount of Sr-88 inO1054  1   15 
           the target was determined by means of an XRF analysis  O1054  1   16 
           before all measurements. It was also checked at the endO1054  1   17 
           of the Stuttgart measurements as well as at the end of O1054  1   18 
           the Athens runs. The thickness of Sr-88 in the target  O1054  1   19 
           before any measurement was 168+-7-mug/cm**2 and the    O1054  1   20 
           material loss was found to be less than 3%. This       O1054  1   21 
           thickness corresponds approximately 12 and 8-KeV at    O1054  1   22 
           beam energies of 2 and 4-MeV,  respectively. These     O1054  1   23 
           values were derived using the SRIM code and assuming   O1054  1   24 
           that the target consists of Sr-88 only. However,       O1054  1   25 
           the thickness of the target is defined by its          O1054  1   26 
           stoichiometry that was determined at the end of the    O1054  1   27 
           measurements by performing a nuclear reaction analysis.O1054  1   28 
           The measurements were necessary to determine correctly O1054  1   29 
           the proton stopping powers.  The measurements were     O1054  1   30 
           performed using a single-charged H2 beam of 1.1-MeV    O1054  1   31 
           energy that was delivered by the tandem accelerator    O1054  1   32 
           of Athens.                                             O1054  1   33 
           The final amount of Sr-88 in the target, according to  O1054  1   34 
           the XRF analyses, did not differ practically from that O1054  1   35 
           in the beginning of the measurements allows to         O1054  1   36 
           calculate the maximum total target thickness by varyingO1054  1   37 
           the ratio of the amount of the Sr-88(NO3)2 to the      O1054  1   38 
            Sr-88(OH)2 phase. The maximum thickness obtained this O1054  1   39 
           way is 405 mug/cm**2, that corresponds to 44 and 28-KeVO1054  1   40 
           at 2 and 4-MeV, respectively. This thickness is derivedO1054  1   41 
           if the target is comprised of the Sr-88(NO3)2 phase    O1054  1   42 
           only. Even in such an extreme case the uncertainty     O1054  1   43 
           entering the determination of the corresponding        O1054  1   44 
           effective energies is less than 0.5%.                  O1054  1   45

COMMENT    *By authors. In experimental setup used in Stuttgart   O1054  1   56 
           the target was placed at 90-degree to the beam axis.   O1054  1   57 
           Its backing was cooled directly with water during the  O1054  1   58 
           whole experiments. The detector were placed on a       O1054  1   59 
           rotating table at distances between 10 and 20-cm front O1054  1   60 
           the target.                                            O1054  1   61 
           In  experimental setup used in Athens the target was   O1054  1   62 
           placed at 20-degree with respect to the beam axis.     O1054  1   63 
           The distance between the target-center and the         O1054  1   64 
           detector-front was 12-cm. The detector was placed      O1054  1   65 
           on a goniometrical table that could rotate around the  O1054  1   66 
           target with an accuracy better than 1-degree. In order O1054  1   67 
           to measure gamma angular distributions at each beam    O1054  1   68 
           energy, gamma-singles spectra were taken at six angles O1054  1   69 
           with the respect to the beam. The target backing was   O1054  1   70 
           cooled with air during all measurements.               O1054  1   71 
           As in case of the measurements in Stuttgart, backgroundO1054  1   72 
           spectra were also measured, in order to investigate    O1054  1   73 
           possible yield contributions from the backing material.O1054  1   74 
           In both the Stuttgart and Athens experiments, the      O1054  1   75 
           absolute efficiency data were checked for uncertaintiesO1054  1   76 
           due to coincident summing.                             O1054  1   77
