SAMPLE     Drops of natural metallic mercury with thickness       O1264  3    6

COMMENT    -By authors. The target thickness-445 mg/cm**2 and the O1264  3   13 
           incident proton energy 19-MeV were chosen to minimize  O1264  3   14 
           the production of other radioisotopes of thallium,     O1264  3   15 
           which could lead to impurities in the Tl-201 product.  O1264  3   16
