SAMPLE     Targets used in this experiment consisted of           O0415  1    8 
           cylindrical pilot b plastic scintillators 1/8 in. thickO0415  1    9 
           and 5/8 in. diam., containing 91.55% carbon by         O0415  1   10 
           weight.                                                O0415  1   11 
           For each irradiation a target was carefully aligned    O0415  1   12 
           with and taped directly to the upstream side of        O0415  1   13 
           scintillation counters, which was the same size as     O0415  1   14 
           the target.                                            O0415  1   15 
           Each one of the targets was irradiated in the proton   O0415  1   16 
           beam for approximately 20 min.                         O0415  1   17

           1/8-in. thick and either 5/8 or 1 in. diam. was        O0415  1   19 
           optically coupled via a 6-in. -long by 1/8-in. -thick  O0415  1   20

METHOD     (ACTIV) Starting about 10 min after the end of an      O0415  1   23 
           irradiation, the c-11 activity was measured either by  O0415  1   24 
           internal scintillation counting or by positron-        O0415  1   25 
           annihilation radiation counting.                       O0415  1   26

           (EXTB) Pi+ Mesons contamination of the beam was less   O0415  1   28 
           than 4%.                                               O0415  1   29 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Each decay curve was analyzed.                 O0415  1   30 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors assigned to a measurement are made  O0415  1   31 
           up of the standard deviation of the counting rate,     O0415  1   32 
           the uncertainty in counting efficiency and             O0415  1   33 
           (ERR-1) error in aligning the target with the counter  O0415  1   34 
           telescope.                                             O0415  1   35 
           (ERR-2) error 1.5% was assigned to represent the       O0415  1   36 
           accuracy of the coincidence method of source           O0415  1   37 
           calibration.                                           O0415  1   38 
CORRECTION /by Authors/. A secondary-effect correction was then   O0415  1   39 
           calculated as a function of target thickness.          O0415  1   40 
           After the target thickness correction was made, the    O0415  1   41 
           cross section was then corrected for the pi+           O0415  1   42 
           contamination of the beam by using the C-12(pin,pin+n) O0415  1   43 
           cross section and assuming that the pi+ cross section  O0415  1   44 
           is the same as the pi- cross section and the pion crossO0415  1   45 
           section is the same at 8.5 GeV/C.                      O0415  1   46
