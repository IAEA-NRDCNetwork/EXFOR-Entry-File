COMMENT    -By Authors- The observed triple events might be       O063800100016 
           subdivided into two types:                             O063800100017 
           Type 1 includes the events in which all three          O063800100018 
           particles have comparable ranges and charges.          O063800100019 
           Type 2 includes the events in which one of the three   O063800100020 
           multicharged particles possesses much greater range    O063800100021 
           than the other two.                                    O063800100022 
           -By Compiler- The data given under column 'DATA'       O063800100023 
           relate only to the triple events of type 2. This is    O063800100024 
           assumed by compiler, on the basis of a comparison with O063800100025 
           the data in REL-REF.                                   O063800100026
