SAMPLE     A 100-mm diameter gas cell, filled with helium, more   O108100100018 
            99.995% purity, to a nominal absolute pressure of 1.5 O108100100019 
           bar at room temperature, was bombarded with alpha-     O108100100020 
           particles.                                             O108100100021 
           The effective target length and solid angle were       O108100100022 
           defined by means of a double-aperture collimator systemO108100100023 
           with 3-mm thick tantalum front and rear slits. The     O108100100024 
           slits were placed 186 and 526-mm, respectively, from   O108100100025 
           the center of the target. The rather large distance    O108100100026 
           from the gas cell and large separation between slits   O108100100027 
           ensured that measurements could be performed down to   O108100100028 
           very forward angles with small effective target and    O108100100029 
           good angular resolution. At forward angles smaller thanO108100100030 
            26-degree, 2.8 mm wide slits were used, while 4.5-mm  O108100100031 
            wide slits were employed at larger angles in order to O108100100032 
           increase the count rate. The effective target length   O108100100033 
           varied between 8 and 28-mm, i.e., Weel distant from theO108100100034 
            6-mum thick HAVAR entrance and exit windows of the gasO108100100035 
           cell.                                                  O108100100036 
DETECTOR   (TELES) Different detector telescopes were used in the O108100100037 
            158- and 200-MeV measurements. For the 158-MeV runs   O108100100038 
           the telescope consisted of a 150-mum thick Si surface  O108100100039 
           barrier delta-E detector, followed by two Si-Li        O108100100040 
           detectors of 5-mm nominal thickness each, followed by aO108100100041 
            1-mm thick Si surface-barrier veto detector.          O108100100042 
           For the 200-MeV runs the front delta-E element was     O108100100043 
           replaced with a 2-mm thick Si surface-barrier detector.O108100100044 
           The standard delta-E-E technique was used for particle O108100100045
