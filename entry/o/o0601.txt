SAMPLE     Platinum layer was evaporated in vacuum                O0601  1   10 
           onto the detector surface. Target thickness            O0601  1   11 
           was about 100 Angstrom. The surface of the             O0601  1   12 
           sample was normal to the proton beam.                  O0601  1   13

DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of    O0601  1   15 
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a sandwich.O0601  1   16 
           detector was sensitive to fragments with A>=16.        O0601  1   17 
           Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside the       O0601  1   18 
           Makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in a 4pi    O0601  1   19 
           geometry.                                              O0601  1   20 
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal  O0601  1   21 
           of the detector material in the course of chemical     O0601  1   22 
           treatment.                                             O0601  1   23 
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individualO0601  1   24 
           tracks and an individual track with binary events.     O0601  1   25 
COMMENT    - By Authors - Eventswith two tracks with a solid      O0601  1   26 
           angle between them larger than 90 degrees, and events  O0601  1   27 
           with three correlated tracks whose lengths were greaterO0601  1   28 
           than 3 um were taken as binary and ternary fission     O0601  1   29 
           respectively.                                          O0601  1   30
