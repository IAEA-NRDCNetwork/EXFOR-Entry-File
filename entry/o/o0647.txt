SAMPLE     Self-supporting targets, about 1 mg/cm**2 thick, were  O064700100012 
           made by evaporation for gold and by rolling for        O064700100013 
           thorium. The targets were oriented at 45 degrees with  O064700100014 
           respect to the beam direction.                         O064700100015

           (EDE) 'E/Delta E' Information was used to separate     O064700100017

           At higher energies, a secondary-electron-emission      O064700100020 
           detector was used, calibrated with the use of the      O064700100021 
            Faraday cup.                                          O064700100022 
DETECTOR   (COIN,IOCH,IOCH) Two identical position-sensitive      O064700100023 
           ionization chambers. One of them was movable in a      O064700100024 
           vertical plane, from -2 to +12 degrees, and was placed O064700100025 
           at angle -90 degrees with respect to the beam          O064700100026 
           direction. The second one was movable in a horizontal  O064700100027 
           plane from 10 to 170 degrees on the opposite side of   O064700100028 
           the beam and had an angular aperture of 8 degrees.     O064700100029
