SAMPLE     Thorium samples were prepared using Th-O/2 on 0.0508 mmO0965  1   15 
           thick aluminum discs. The thickness of thorium was     O0965  1   16 
           1.5 mg/cm**2 thick, on the average.  The thicknesses   O0965  1   17 
           were found to be uniform within 3% by measuring alpha  O0965  1   18 
           activities from five 3-mm spots in each foil.  A stack O0965  1   19 
           of seven targets at a time, separated with pieces of   O0965  1   20 
           aluminum foil was placed into a sample holder.         O0965  1   21

COMMENT    -By authors. Two irradiations, lasting 11 and 200      O0965  1   31 
           minutes, were carried out and total proton charges of  O0965  1   32 
           1.5 and 108.1 milliCoulomb were collected,             O0965  1   33 
           respectively.                                          O0965  1   34 
           -By authors. The values are the weighted means         O0965  1   35 
           calculated from 2 to 5 separate activity measurements  O0965  1   36 
           of each foil, run after different decay periods in     O0965  1   37 
           order to be sure of the correct half-life.             O0965  1   38 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error limits given 1-sigma are the      O0965  1   39 
           weighted standard deviations of the means or the pooledO0965  1   40 
           standard deviations, whichever is bigger.  The error   O0965  1   41 
           of the activities include uncertainties in absolute    O0965  1   42 
           detector efficiencies and gamma intensities, as well asO0965  1   43 
           in peak areas calculated by the analysis program.      O0965  1   44
