SAMPLE     Au-foils of 22 um thickness.  After the bombardments   O1340  3    5 
           the produced Hg was separated from the remaining Au.   O1340  3    6 
           An irradiated Au-foil was heated in vacuum to 800      O1340  3    7

           quartz flask, which was held at the temperature of     O1340  3    9 
           liquid nitrogen.  It was carefully checked that at     O1340  3   10
