SAMPLE     For the preparation of the targets containing mug-     O123600100013 
           amounts of Ra-226, aliquots of 10-mul of stock solutionO123600100014 
           were slowly evaporated on thin silver foils and coveredO123600100015 
           with a second silver foil. The silver foil sandwiches  O123600100016 
           were pressed and encapsulated in silver capsules, whichO123600100017 
           were subsequently transferred to a glove box and weldedO123600100018 
           gas-tight. For irradiation experiments using larger    O123600100019 
           amounts of radium, an aliquot of radium stock solution O123600100020 
           typically containing 30-mg of radium-226, was mixed    O123600100021 
           with a stock solution containing 300-mg of Ba-Cl(3) in O123600100022 
           dilute HCL. Barium was used as matrix due to the       O123600100023 
           similar chemical properties of Ba- and Ra. The mixture O123600100024 
           was evaporated, the residual solid phase was ground in O123600100025 
           amortar and pressed into a pellet of 16-mm in diameter O123600100026 
           and 0.8-1.0-mm in height. Subsequently, the pellets    O123600100027 
           were enclosed in silver capsules which were welded gas-O123600100028 
           tight.                                                 O123600100029
