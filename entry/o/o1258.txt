SAMPLE     An amorphous deuterated hydrocarbon a-C:d-film,        O125800100011 
           deposited on optically flat Si-plates by means of an   O125800100012 
           radio-frequency discharge from CD(4), was used as      O125800100013 
           deuterium target.  The thickness of the a-C:D-film was O125800100014 
            4.4*10E+17 carbon/cm**2 with a D/C-ratio of 0.32.     O125800100015 
           About 3*10E+15 atoms/ cm**2 gold were evaporated on theO125800100016 
           surface of the a-C:D film.  The Au was used as a markerO125800100017

DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A wide-angle surface-barrier detector with a   O125800100025 
           solid angle of 0.14-Sr and a depletion depth of 700-mumO125800100026

           absorber foil with a thickness of 20-mum and a 150-mum O125800100028 
           stainless steel foil were positioned in front of the   O125800100029 
           detector. These foils absorb elastically scattered He-3O125800100030
