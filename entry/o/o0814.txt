DETECTOR   (SOLST).Two high-efficiency germanium detectors were   O081400100016

           used detector is absent.                               O081400100018

FACILITY   (OLMS,2BLGLVN) At the Leuven Isotope Separator on-line O081400100021 
           with an ion-guide laser ion source.                    O081400100022 
METHOD     (OLMS) Two U-238 targets were installed in a gas cell  O081400100023 
           filled with the 500 mbar of argon. The reaction recoil O081400100024 
           products were thermalized and neutralized in the bufferO081400100025 
           gas. The gas flow transported  the atoms into the beam O081400100026 
           paths of two excimer-pumped dye lasers, that           O081400100027 
           selectively ionized the nickel atoms in the two-step   O081400100028 
           process. At the exit hole of the gas cell, the ions    O081400100029 
           were injected into sextupole ion guide, connecting the O081400100030 
           high pressure area of gas cell to the low pressure zoneO081400100031 
           of the mass-separator.                                 O081400100032
