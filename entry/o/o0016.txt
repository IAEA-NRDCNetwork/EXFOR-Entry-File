ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties of the peak sums were        O001600100022 
           calculated with the use of the error matrix of the     O001600100023 
           searched parameters in fitting.  Therefore, these      O001600100024 
           uncertainties also contain the ambiguities of the peak O001600100025 
           shape.                                                 O001600100026
