COMMENT    /by Authors/.In the Case of the Radiochemical Method,  O042000300005 
           A Measurement of the Amount of Be-10 Formed in a Given O042000300006 
           Irradiation is Difficult Due to the Fact That the      O042000300007 
           Activity of the Short-Lived Be-7 (HALF-LIFE=53.6 D)    O042000300008 
           Interferes with the Measurements of the B-Activity     O042000300009 
           Of Be-10 (E(MAX)=0.55 MEV), the Interference is        O042000300010 
           Appreciable in Spite of the Fact That Be-7 is a Gamma- O042000300011 
           Emitter. Therefore, It Becomes Necessary to Wait For   O042000300012 
           Several Years After an Irradiation to Allow the Be-7   O042000300013 
           Activity to Decay to a Level Where Its Presence Does   O042000300014 
           Not Contribute any Significant Counting in the         O042000300015
