SAMPLE     The target,a Uranium filament with a diameter of 0.13mmO071700100012 
           was adjusted by optical means at the centre of a       O071700100013 
           cylinder (R=65 mm). The target can be moved in two     O071700100014 
           perpendicular directions at the two points where it    O071700100015 
           was fastened to the cylinder.                          O071700100016 
           The fragments emitted from the target were collected inO071700100017 
           TEN polyethylene foils mounted around the cylinder.    O071700100018 
           The thickness of the catcher foils was 9.2 mg/cm**2,   O071700100019 
           that is a few times the maximum range of fission       O071700100020 
           fragments. By adding a second foil behind each catcher O071700100021 
           foil, it was checked that the only activity produced   O071700100022 
           in the plastic foils is C-11.                          O071700100023
