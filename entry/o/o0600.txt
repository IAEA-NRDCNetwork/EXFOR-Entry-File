TITLE       An analysis of the binary and ternary fission         O0600  1    3

SAMPLE      A Layer of natural uranium of a thickness of          O0600  1    9 
            (1.2+-0.10)*10**3 Angstrem was evaporated in vacuum   O0600  1   10 
           onto one of the detector foils on the inner side.      O0600  1   11 
           The surface of the sample was parallel to the proton   O0600  1   12 
           beam.                                                  O0600  1   13

DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of    O0600  1   15 
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a sandwich.O0600  1   16 
           Detector was sensitive to fragments with A>=16.        O0600  1   17 
           Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside the       O0600  1   18 
           Makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in a 4pi    O0600  1   19 
           geometry.                                              O0600  1   20 
CORRECTION  Performed: loss of events of about 2% due to removal  O0600  1   21 
           of the detector material in the course of chemical     O0600  1   22 
           treatment.                                             O0600  1   23 
           Negligible:  casual coincidences between two individualO0600  1   24

COMMENT     By Authors. We mean by binary fission those events in O0600  1   34 
           which two fragments of A>16 are produced with an angle O0600  1   35 
           between larger than 90 angular degrees.                O0600  1   36
