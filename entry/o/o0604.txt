TITLE      An analysis of gold fission induced by high-energy     O0604  1    3 
           protons                                                O0604  1    4 
COMMENT    - By Authors - The high-energy binary and ternary      O0604  1    5 
           fission is defined as a decay of a nucleus into two andO0604  1    6 
           three fragments of comparable mass, respectively.      O0604  1    7

SAMPLE     Layers of gold of a thickness of 200-500 Angstrom      O0604  1   13 
           were evaporated in vacuum onto one of the detector     O0604  1   14 
           foils on the inner side.                               O0604  1   15 
           The surface of the sample was parallel to the proton   O0604  1   16 
           beam for the irradiation at 12.2 GeV and normal to the O0604  1   17 
           proton beam for irradiations at the other energies.    O0604  1   18 
METHOD     (FISCT)                                                O0604  1   19 
DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of    O0604  1   20 
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a sandwich.O0604  1   21 
           Detector was sensitive to fragments with A>=16. Heavy  O0604  1   22 
           reaction fragments were stopped inside the Makrofol    O0604  1   23 
           sheets and could thus be detected in a 4pi geometry.   O0604  1   24 
CORRECTION Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal   O0604  1   25 
           of the detector material in the course of chemical     O0604  1   26 
           treatment.                                             O0604  1   27 
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individualO0604  1   28
