           25 Mugramm/Cm**2 Thick, Mounted in 11*12 Cm Aluminum   O061800100013 
           Frames. For Ta Targets the Metal was Deposited in      O061800100014 
           Vacuum onto a Glass Surface Previoisly Coated with     O061800100015 
           About 5 Mugramm/Cm**2 of Carbon to Facilitate Removal  O061800100016 
           Of the Ta by Flotation on Water. The Metal Film Could  O061800100017 
           Then be Placed in the Center of a Thin Cellulose       O061800100018 
           Acetate Support by Raising the Support Film Under the  O061800100019 
           Floating Ta. Target Thicknesses were About 50          O061800100020 
           Mugramm/Cm**2 For U and About 300 Mugramm/Cm**2 For Ta.O061800100021

           Detect and Measure Energies of the Fission Fragments.  O061800100024 
           The Sensitive Volumes were Cylindrical, Mostly About   O061800100025 
           24 mm in Diameter and 50 Mu-Meter Thick. Detectors     O061800100026 
           Were Mounted on Arms So That the Angles They Subtended O061800100027 
           At the Target Could be Changed. Detector to            O061800100028 
           Target Distance was 30 - 40 Cm.                        O061800100029 
           Discriminators were Set to Cutoff Pulses Smaller Than  O061800100030
