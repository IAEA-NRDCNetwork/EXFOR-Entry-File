SAMPLE     The thin U targets were produced by vacuum deposition  O0618  1   11 
           of U-F4 onto cellulose acetate supporting films, about O0618  1   12 
           25 um/cm2 thick, mounted in 11*12 cm aluminum frames.  O0618  1   13 
           For Ta targets the metal was deposited in vacuum onto aO0618  1   14 
           glass surface previously coated with about 5 um/cm2 of O0618  1   15 
           carbon to facilitate removal of the Ta by flotation on O0618  1   16 
           water. The metal film could then be placed in the      O0618  1   17 
           center of a thin cellulose acetate support by raising  O0618  1   18 
           the support film under the floating Ta.                O0618  1   19 
           Target thicknesses were about 50 um/cm2 for U and aboutO0618  1   20 
           300 um/cm2 for Ta.                                     O0618  1   21 
METHOD     (FISCT,EXTB,SITA,COINC,PHD,BCINT)                      O0618  1   22 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface-barrier detectors were used to O0618  1   23 
           detect and measure energies of the fission fragments.  O0618  1   24 
           The sensitive volumes were cylindrical, mostly about   O0618  1   25 
           24 mm in diameter and 50 um thick. Detectors           O0618  1   26 
           were mounted on arms so that the angles they subtended O0618  1   27 
           at the target could be changed. Detector to            O0618  1   28 
           target distance was 30 - 40 cm.                        O0618  1   29 
           Discriminators were set to cutoff pulses smaller than  O0618  1   30 
           those corresponding to 30-MeV fission fragments.       O0618  1   31
