SAMPLE     High purity, more than 99.9% yttrium metallic foils.   O1960  1   12 
           One or two thin discs, thickness = 0.15 mm, diameter = O1960  1   13 
            14 mm of Y-89 were firmly positioned in a copper      O1960  1   14 
           backing support, diameter = 32 mm, depth = 1 mm, havingO1960  1   15 
           a central cavity, diameter =14 mm, depth =0.15 or      O1960  1   16 
            0.30 mm). The target was covered by an aluminium disc O1960  1   17 
           of 32 mm diameter and 0.5 mm thickness.                O1960  1   18 
           The aluminium disc allows for degradation of the energyO1960  1   19 
           of the incident proton beam and protects the yttrium   O1960  1   20 
           target foil from possible motion due to the incident   O1960  1   21 
           high-pressure helium flow.                             O1960  1   22 
MONITOR    Cu monitor foils were included in the stack to         O1960  1   23

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The high purity Germanium detector has a 30%    O1960  1   26 
           relative efficiency and a resolution of 1.8 keV at     O1960  1   27 
            1332 keV.                                             O1960  1   28 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total uncertainty includes:                    O1960  1   29 
           (ERR-1,1.,2.).Error in the calibration of the referenceO1960  1   30 
           source 1-2% at 1 sigma level, depending on the peak in O1960  1   31

           covariance matrix of the fitting of the efficiency     O1960  1   33 
           curve (typically less than 3%). The calibration        O1960  1   34 
           uncertainty thus amounts to about 4-5% at 1 sigma levelO1960  1   35
