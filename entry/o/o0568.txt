           (CHSEP) Chemical yields were determined gravimetricallyO056800100019 
           for silver chloride. Otherwise the 1.3-Yr Cd-109 in theO056800100020 
           cadmium carrier was used as internal monitor for yield O056800100021 
           determinations. A 12 mg/cm**2 aluminium foils was used O056800100022 
           to absorb the conversion electrons from Cd-109 when    O056800100023 
            2.3-days Cd-115-G and 43-days Cd-115-M were beta      O056800100024 
           counted. The Recovered amount of Cd-109 was determined O056800100025 
           either by counting of the 88-keV gamma peak or by beta O056800100026 
           counting with the aluminium foil removed [after the    O056800100027 
           cadmium activity had decayed for 8-10 months].         O056800100028 
           (ACTIV) Beam intensity of Stockholm Institute was 50   O056800100029 
           muA, approximately.  Beam intensity at Karlsruhe was   O056800100030 
           1-4 muA. The standard irradiation time was 10 min, but O056800100031 
           2 min and 30 min were also performed.                  O056800100032 
CORRECTION To determine the yield ratio of the cadmium isomers,   O056800100033 
           these were separated from 21-min Ag-115 after a        O056800100034 
           complete decay of other short lived precursors.  Since,O056800100035 
           however, the time used for separation is somewhat less O056800100036 
           than the half-Live of 21-min Ag-115 appropriate        O056800100037 
           corrections are determined by measuring the amounts of O056800100038 
           cadmium grown from isolated 21-min Ag-115.             O056800100039

COMMENT    - By Compiler - 50 sec isomer of Ag-115 decays to      O056800200011 
           ground state of 115-Cd only.  Therefore 115-M-Cd       O056800200012 
           production may be assumed as independent, but 115-G-Cd O056800200013 
           production includes production due to 50 sec 115-M-Ag  O056800200014
