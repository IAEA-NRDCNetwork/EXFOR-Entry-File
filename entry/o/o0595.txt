ERR-ANALYS The Errors Associated with the Fractional Yield Data   O059500100031 
           Are Due Mainly to Uncertainty in the Exact Proton      O059500100032

           Losses in the Target Itself.Nevertheless the Beam      O059500100035 
           Energy was Probably Known to 2-5 MeV.The DisintegrationO059500100036

           That an Uncertainty of +-10-15% on an Over-All Basis   O059500100042

           Fission Products by Twice Extracting.The Time of the   O059500200014 
           Second Ether Extraction was Used As the Time of        O059500200015 
           Separation of Ga-72 from Zn-72.Gallium was Further     O059500200016 
           Purified by a Number of Scavenging Precipitations and  O059500200017 
           Repeated Extractions.The Two Samples Obtained,Ga-1 and O059500200018 
           Ga-2 were Made to Equal Volume in Counting Vials and   O059500200019

           Ga-1 Showed a Very High Proportion of the 4.87-Hour    O059500200023

           Ga-72 Could be Quate Easily Measured,Although at the   O059500200025 
           Very Lowest Bombardment Energies the Activity of Ga-72 O059500200026
