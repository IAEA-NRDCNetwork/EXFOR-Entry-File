COMMENT    -By authors. In order to separate out the contributionsO123700300007 
           due to In-113(p,n) and In-115(p,3n) reactions at 18.31 O123700300008 
           and 20 MeV, the ratio of cross-sections                O123700300009 
            sigma(p,n)/sigma(p,3n) are calculated theoretically   O123700300010 
           using the code ALICE-91, with those parameters which   O123700300011 
           gave a satisfactory reproduction of the lower energy   O123700300012 
           data for this reaction. The contribution of two        O123700300013 
           reactions has been separated taking into account the   O123700300014 
           relative abundances of 113-In and 115-In isotopes and  O123700300015 
           the theoretical cross-section ratios. In this way the  O123700300016 
           cross-sections for (p,3n) reaction at 18.31 and 20 MeV O123700300017 
           are found to be ~5.9 mb and ~43,3 mb respectively.     O123700300018
