SAMPLE     Thorium layers were evaporated in vacuum onto the      O0603  1   10 
           detector surface. target thickness was 200-500 AngstromO0603  1   11 
           The surface of the sample was normal to the            O0603  1   12 
           proton beam.                                           O0603  1   13

DETECTOR   (TRD) Makrofol polycarbonate detectors consisted of    O0603  1   15 
           two sheets of a size of 3*4*0.02 cm forming a          O0603  1   16 
           sandwich. Detector was sensitive to fragments with     O0603  1   17 
           A>=16. Heavy reaction fragments were stopped inside    O0603  1   18 
           the Makrofol sheets and could thus be detected in a    O0603  1   19 
           4Pi geometry.                                          O0603  1   20 
CORRECTION  Performed: Loss of events of about 2% due to removal  O0603  1   21 
           of the detector material in the course of chemical     O0603  1   22 
           treatment.                                             O0603  1   23 
           Negligible:  Casual coincidences between two individualO0603  1   24 
           tracks and an individual track with binary events.     O0603  1   25 
COMMENT    - By Authors- Binary fission induced by high-energy    O0603  1   26 
           particles is defined as a decay of nucleus into two    O0603  1   27 
           fragments of approximately equal masses with an angle  O0603  1   28 
           between their emission directions larger than 90 degr. O0603  1   29 
           Events with three tracks are defined as ternary fissionO0603  1   30 
           regardless of the mechanism of their production.       O0603  1   31
