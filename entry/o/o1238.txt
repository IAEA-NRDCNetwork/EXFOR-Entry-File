SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure cobalt foils with purity better O1238  1   10 
           than 99.9% were used as target. Target foils of        O1238  1   11 
           thickness 11.25-mg/cm**2 were cut into pieces of 15-mm*O1238  1   12 
            15-mm and glued with zapon onto identical aluminum    O1238  1   13 
           holders with concentric holes of 10-mm diameter at     O1238  1   14 
           their centers. Samples for irradiated were taken in theO1238  1   15 
           form of a stack of these targets. Aluminum target      O1238  1   16 
           holders were used for rapid heat dissipation. In order O1238  1   17 
           to achieve the desired variation in incident energy,   O1238  1   18 
           aluminum foils of thickness 6.75-mg/cm**2 were         O1238  1   19 
           sandwiched between successive target samples of the    O1238  1   20 
           stack as energy degraders.                             O1238  1   21

           Mukherjee+ values are lower by a factor of ten than ourO1238  3   11 
           values at low projectile energies, while at a          O1238  3   12 
           projectile energy of 32 MeV and above their values are O1238  3   13 
           higher by a factor of about two.                       O1238  3   14 
           Rao+ measurements are higher by a factor of 1.5 - 2 in O1238  3   15

            Michel+ are generally in agreement with ours, between O1238  4   12 
           34 MeV and 44 MeV, while above 44 MeV they are higher  O1238  4   13 
           than ours. Moreover, below 34 MeV the results          O1238  4   14 
           of Michel+ and Rao+ are exceptionally low by an order  O1238  4   15 
           of magnitude.                                          O1238  4   16
