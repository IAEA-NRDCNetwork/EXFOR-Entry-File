SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure cobalt foils with purity better O123800100013 
           than 99.9% were used as target. Target foils of        O123800100014 
           thickness 11.25-mg/cm**2 were cut into pieces of 15-mm*O123800100015 
            15-mm and glued with zapon onto identical aluminum    O123800100016 
           holders with concentric holes of 10-mm diameter at     O123800100017 
           their centers. Samples for irradiated were taken in theO123800100018 
           form of a stack of these targets. Aluminum target      O123800100019 
           holders were used for rapid heat dissipation. In order O123800100020 
           to achieve the desired variation in incident energy,   O123800100021 
           aluminum foils of thickness 6.75-mg/cm**2 were         O123800100022 
           sandwiched between successive target samples of the    O123800100023

           - By authors. It is noticeable that below 34 MeV, the  O123800400010 
           measurements of Mukherjee+ are a little lower than our O123800400011 
           measurements. The cross-sections reported by Rao+ and  O123800400012 
            Michel+ are generally in agreement with ours, between O123800400013 
           34 MeV and 44 MeV, while above 44 MeV they are higher  O123800400014 
           than ours. Moreover, below 34 MeV the results          O123800400015 
           of Michel+ and Rao+ are exceptionally low by an order  O123800400016 
           of magnitude.                                          O123800400017
