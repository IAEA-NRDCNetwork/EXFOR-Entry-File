FACILITY   (CCW,2UK BIR) Protons extracted from a radio-          O0917  1    8 
           frequency ion source were accelerated in a vertical    O0917  1    9 
           two-stage vacuum tube.                                 O0917  1   10 
SAMPLE     The B-10 targets were prepared by electromagnetic      O0917  1   11 
           deposition of the isotope on copper. Two thin targets  O0917  1   12 
           of 90 ug/cm2 and 120 ug/cm2 (accurate to 10%) and      O0917  1   13 
           one thick target,400 mug/cm**2, were used. The         O0917  1   14 
           thickness of this last target was determined by        O0917  1   15 
           weighing the backing foil before and after deposition. O0917  1   16 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The alpha particles were detected by a zinc     O0917  1   17 
           sulphide screen and photomultiplier.                   O0917  1   18 
METHOD     (BCINT) Target currents were always measured with the  O0917  1   19 
           target at a sufficiently large positive potential to   O0917  1   20 
           retain secondary electrons.                            O0917  1   21

COMMENT    - By authors.  Relative value of the cross section at  O0917  3    5 
           lower energies were obtained using a thick target and  O0917  3    6 
           the analyser for proton energies down to 120 KeV. For  O0917  3    7 
           energies below 120-KeV a simple target chamber         O0917  3    8 
           employing range discrimination, and with a much larger O0917  3    9 
           solid angle than the analyser was used. The alpha      O0917  3   10 
           particles were detected by a zinc sulphide screen and  O0917  3   11 
           photomultiplier. These observations were fitted to the O0917  3   12 
           absolute determinations at 180 and 205 KeV.            O0917  3   13 
ADD-RES    The data are presented as Gamov plot too.              O0917  3   14
