SAMPLE     The B-10 targets were prepared by electromagnetic      O091700100010 
           deposition of the isotope on copper.  Two thin targets O091700100011 
           of 90 mug/cm**2 and 120 mug/cm**2 (accurate to 10%) andO091700100012 
           one thick target,400 mug/cm**2, were used.  The        O091700100013 
           thickness of this last target was determined by        O091700100014 
           weighing the backing foil before and after  deposition.O091700100015 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The alpha particles were detected by a zinc     O091700100016

COMMENT    - By authors.  Relative value of the cross section at  O091700300005 
           lower energies were obtained using a thick target and  O091700300006 
           the analyser for proton energies down to 120 KeV. For  O091700300007 
           energies below 120-KeV a simple target chamber         O091700300008 
           employing range discrimination, and with a much larger O091700300009 
           solid angle than the analyser was used. The alpha      O091700300010 
           particles were detected by a zinc sulphide screen and  O091700300011 
           photomultiplier. These observations were fitted to the O091700300012 
           absolute determinations at 180 and 205 KeV.            O091700300013
