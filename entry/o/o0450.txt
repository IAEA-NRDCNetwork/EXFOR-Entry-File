SAMPLE     Three types of targets were used. The targets for whichO0450  1   10 
           the beam intensity was monitored consisted of a Cu     O0450  1   11 
           target foil, a 0.001-inch Al monitor foil and two or   O0450  1   12 
           three aluminum guard foils.                            O0450  1   13 
           The foils for the cosmotron targets were aligned with  O0450  1   14 
           shears prior to irradiation except for one guard foil  O0450  1   15 
           which protruded 0.5-1 mm beyond the leading edge of theO0450  1   16 
           aligned foils. Alignment of the foils in the monitored O0450  1   17 
           ags targets was achieved by punching a 7/16-inch-diam. O0450  1   18 
           Circle through the foil stack about 1 mm back from the O0450  1   19 
           leading edge after irradiation.                        O0450  1   20 
           When only the sigma (Ni-65)/sigma (Ni-57) was to be    O0450  1   21 
           measured, the target consisted of a Cu foil and two Al O0450  1   22 
           guard foils.                                           O0450  1   23 
           The targets for the recoil measurements consisted of  aO0450  1   24 
           Cu target foil, two 0.00025-inch Mylar catcher foils,  O0450  1   25 
           one 0.00025-inch Mylar foils for an activation blank   O0450  1   26 
           and two 0.00025-inch Mylar guard foils.                O0450  1   27 
           All of the Cu targets from which cross sections for    O0450  1   28 
           the production of Ni-65 were measured, either directly O0450  1   29 
           or relative to the cross section for Ni-57, were taken O0450  1   30 
           from the same stock of 0.00033-inch Cu foil whose      O0450  1   31 
           purity was greater than 99.99%.  The thicker targets   O0450  1   32 
           were made up of several layers of this foil.           O0450  1   33
