SAMPLE     Three types of targets were used. The targets for whichO045000100015 
           the beam intensity was monitored consisted of a Cu     O045000100016 
           target foil, a 0.001-inch Al monitor foil and two or   O045000100017 
           three alumimum guard foils.                            O045000100018 
           The foils for the cosmotron targets were aligned with  O045000100019 
           shears prior to irradiation except for one guard foil  O045000100020 
           which protruded 0.5-1 mm beyond the leading edge of theO045000100021 
           aligned foils. Alignment of the foils in the monitored O045000100022 
           ags targets was achieved by punching a 7/16-inch-diam. O045000100023 
           Circle through the foil stack about 1 mm back from the O045000100024 
           leading edge after irradiation.                        O045000100025 
           When only the sigma (Ni-65)/sigma (Ni-57) was to be    O045000100026 
           measured, the target consisted of a Cu foil and two Al O045000100027 
           guard foils.                                           O045000100028 
           The targets for the recoil measurements consisted of  aO045000100029 
           Cu target foil, two 0.00025-inch Mylar catcher foils,  O045000100030 
           one 0.00025-inch Mylar foils for an activation blank   O045000100031 
           and two 0.00025-inch Mylar guard foils.                O045000100032 
           All of the Cu targets from which cross sections for    O045000100033 
           the production of Ni-65 were measured, either directly O045000100034 
           or relative to the cross section for Ni-57, were taken O045000100035 
           from the same stock of 0.00033-inch Cu foil whose      O045000100036 
           purity was greater than 99.99%.  The thicker targets   O045000100037 
           were made up of several layers of this foil.           O045000100038
