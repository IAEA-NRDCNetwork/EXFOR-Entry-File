CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses    O151100200029 
           during and after bombardment, as well as during        O151100200030 
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured byO151100200031 
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with O151100200032 
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.     O151100200033 
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic  O151100200034

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty was estimated to  O151100200036

           (ERR-T) The total uncertainties in the measured cross  O151100200044

           photo-peak integration as well as the uncertainty      O151100200048 
           associated with the beam-loss correction. The latter   O151100200049 
           did not exceed 1.6%.                                   O151100200050

CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses    O151100500031 
           during and after bombardment, as well as during        O151100500032 
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured byO151100500033 
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with O151100500034 
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.     O151100500035 
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic  O151100500036

CORRECTION *By authors*.Corrections were made for decay losses    O151100600032 
           during and after bombardment, as well as during        O151100600033 
           counting. For all the stacks, the beam flux measured byO151100600034 
           direct integration did not differ by more than 5% with O151100600035 
           the values determined from the monitor foils sets.     O151100600036 
           Corrections for beam current losses due to nonelastic  O151100600037 
           nuclear interactions were made.                        O151100600038 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-SYS) The systematic uncertainty was estimated to  O151100600039 
            be about 7%, including-                               O151100600040

           (ERR-T) The total uncertainties in the measured cross  O151100600047 
           sections were obtained by summing all the contributing O151100600048 
           uncertainties in quadrature. A variable component      O151100600049 
           includes the uncertainty due to counting statistics andO151100600050 
           photo-peak integration as well as the uncertainty      O151100600051 
           associated with the beam-loss correction. The latter   O151100600052 
           did not exceed 1.6%.                                   O151100600053

SAMPLE     A brass target holder contained an aluminium degrader, O151100800006 
           a Ti-monitor foil and a La(2)O(3) target for each      O151100800007

           beam.                                                  O151100800009 
           The La(2)O(3) disks were pressed from high-purity      O151100800010 
           powder, 99.98% and had a nominal thickness of          O151100800011

           The monitor foils were high purity Ti, 99.99% with     O151100800013 
           a thickness of 13.2-mum.                               O151100800014
