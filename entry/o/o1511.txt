COMMENT    *By authors*.Since Ce-137-m has no precursors,         O1511  5    6 
           excitation function is for its direct production only. O1511  5    7 
SAMPLE     Several composite foil stacks were irradiated at       O1511  5    8 
           primary proton-beam energies  of 97.8+-0.5, 65.5+-0.4  O1511  5    9 
           and 39.6+-0.3 MeV. The stacks consisted of high-purity O1511  5   10 
           Pr-foils of 100 mum  thickness (99.9%), high-purity    O1511  5   11 
           Al- monitor foils of 250 mum thickness (99.999%) and   O1511  5   12 
           groups of 125 mum thick Cu-degrader foils (99.9%) as   O1511  5   13 
           required to obtain well spaced proton energies across  O1511  5   14
