SAMPLE     A 35.0 mg/cm2 CD2 target. Since previous test runs     O0798  1   11 
           have indicated that deuterium vanishes during          O0798  1   12 
           measurements, the deuterium content of the CD2 target  O0798  1   13 
           was continously monitored during the runs by a         O0798  1   14 
           deuterium monitor. However, the observed deuterium     O0798  1   15 
           deterioration was small, in fact less than the         O0798  1   16 
           uncertainty in target thickness.                       O0798  1   17

DETECTOR   (SPEC) The experimental set-up consists of ihe magneticO0798  1   22 
           pair spectrometer PACMAN, a beam monitoring system     O0798  1   23 
           including two threefold scintillation telescopes aimed O0798  1   24 
           at the target and two ion chambers placed in the beam  O0798  1   25 
           behind the scattering chamber.                         O0798  1   26 
COMMENT    -By authors.  The electron-positron pair resulting fromO0798  1   27 
           the virtual photon enter the spectrometer directly     O0798  1   28 
           while the real photons are converted into              O0798  1   29 
           electron-positron pairs in a 12 X 20.6 cm2 converter   O0798  1   30 
           foil located in the fringe field, 58.5 cm from the     O0798  1   31 
           target.  The magnetic field bends the electron and     O0798  1   32 
           positron pair 180 degr., where they reach the          O0798  1   33 
           detectors that give the event trigger and the track    O0798  1   34 
           coordinates.  The detectors are arranged in two        O0798  1   35 
           identical groups that are positioned symmetrically     O0798  1   36 
           above and below the scattering centre.  Each detector  O0798  1   37 
           group consists of three drift chamber packages and     O0798  1   38 
           three planes of trigger scintillators, where each      O0798  1   39 
           scintillator plane consists of four separate detectors.O0798  1   40 
           An event trigger is generated by a simultaneous signal O0798  1   41 
           in all three scintillator planes above and below the   O0798  1   42 
           scattering centre. The measurement of the (p,e+e-)     O0798  1   43 
           reaction cross section is made by simply removing the  O0798  1   44 
           converter at the spectrometer entrance.                O0798  1   45
