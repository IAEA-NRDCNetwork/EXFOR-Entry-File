SAMPLE     A 35.0 mg/cm2 Cd2 target. Since previous test runs     O079800100011 
           have indicated that deuterium vanishes during          O079800100012 
           measurements, the deuterium content of the CD2 target  O079800100013 
           was continously monitored during the runs by a         O079800100014 
           deuterium monitor. However, the observed deuterium     O079800100015 
           deterioration was small, in fact less than the         O079800100016 
           uncertainty in target thickness.                       O079800100017

DETECTOR   (SPEC) The experimental set-up consists of ihe magneticO079800100020 
           pair spectrometer pacman, a beam monitoring system     O079800100021 
           including two threefold scintillation telescopes aimed O079800100022 
           at the target and two ion chambers placed in the beam  O079800100023 
           behind the scattering chamber.                         O079800100024 
COMMENT    -By authors.  The electron-positron pair resulting fromO079800100025 
           the virtual photon enter the spectrometer directly     O079800100026 
           while the real photons are converted into              O079800100027 
           electron-positron pairs in a 12 X 20.6 cm2 converter   O079800100028 
           foil located in the fringe field, 58.5 cm from the     O079800100029 
           target.  The magnetic field bends the electron and     O079800100030 
           positron pair 180 degree, where they reach the         O079800100031 
           detectors that give the event trigger and the track    O079800100032 
           coordinates.  The detectors are arranged in two        O079800100033 
           identical groups that are positioned symmetrically     O079800100034 
           above and below the scattering centre.  Each detector  O079800100035 
           group consists of three drift chamber packages and     O079800100036 
           three planes of trigger scintillators, where each      O079800100037 
           scintillalor plane consists of four separate detectors.O079800100038 
           An event trigger is generated by a simultaneous signal O079800100039 
           in all three scintillalor planes above and below the   O079800100040 
           scattering centre. The measurement of the (p,e+e-)     O079800100041 
           reaction cross section is made by simply removing the  O079800100042 
           converter at the spectrometer entrance.                O079800100043
