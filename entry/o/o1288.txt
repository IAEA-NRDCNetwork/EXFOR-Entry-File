           For the chosen target layer the efficiency of          O1288  1   20

COMMENT    -By authors.  Surprisingly, for the reaction           O1288  1   33 
           Li-7+Bi-209 induced fission cross section was observed O1288  1   34 
           much smaller than the predicted value.  It can be      O1288  1   35 
           preliminary explained as the result of disintegration  O1288  1   36 
           of Li-7 nuclei in the strong field of target nuclei of O1288  1   37 
           Bi-209 into He-4 and H-3 light nuclei.                 O1288  1   38
