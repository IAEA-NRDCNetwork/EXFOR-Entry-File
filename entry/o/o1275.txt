SAMPLE     The thin bismuth layer (3-5-mum) of 10*50-mm area was  O1275  1    8 
           evaporated onto a light (7.5-g) aluminum backing.      O1275  1    9 
           The backing was then released from the target holder   O1275  1   10 
           and used directly for astatine separation via dry      O1275  1   11 
           distillation.                                          O1275  1   12

           (IOCH) The At-211 activity was subsequently measured   O1275  1   14

FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CZRUJF) The U-120M cyclotron.                  O1275  1   16 
METHOD     (INTB) The intensity of the beam varied between 10 and O1275  1   17 
            30-micro-amperes.                                     O1275  1   18 
           (ACTIV) The target was irradiated for 1 -2 hours.      O1275  1   19

COMMENT    -By authors. The overall separation yield of At-211 wasO1275  1   21 
           found to be 65-75%. The activity of at-211 left in the O1275  1   22 
           target was less than 10%. The most serious losses were O1275  1   23 
           probably due to deposition of astatine on the colder   O1275  1   24 
           part of the quartz tube. Separation was finished withinO1275  1   25 
           2-hours after EOB.                                     O1275  1   26

COMMENT    -By authors. The At-211 activity was calculated via    O1275  2   12 
           an 897.80-KeV gamma line of Po-211 and the At-210      O1275  2   13 
           activity via its 1181.39-KeV gamma line.               O1275  2   14 
           Presented data are average for 10 measurements.        O1275  2   15
