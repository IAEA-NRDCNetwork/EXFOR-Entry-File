SAMPLE     The thin bismuth layer (3-5-mum) of 10*50-mm area was  O127500100010 
           evaporated onto a light (7.5-g) aluminium backing.     O127500100011 
           The backing was then released from the target holder   O127500100012 
           and used directly for actatine separation via dry      O127500100013 
           distillation.                                          O127500100014

           (IOCH) The At-211 activity was subsequently measured   O127500100016 
           on a calibrated ionising chamber.                      O127500100017 
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CZRUJF) The U-120m cyclotron.                  O127500100018 
METHOD     (INTB) The intensity of the beam varied between 10 and O127500100019 
            30-micro-amperes.                                     O127500100020 
           (ACTIV) The target was irradiated for 1 -2 hours.      O127500100021

COMMENT    -By authors. The overall separation yield of At-211 wasO127500100023 
           found to be 65-75%. The activity of at-211 left in the O127500100024 
           target was less than 10%. The most serious losses were O127500100025 
           probably due to deposition of astatine on the colder   O127500100026 
           part of the quartz tube. Separation was finished withinO127500100027 
           2-hours after EOB.                                     O127500100028
