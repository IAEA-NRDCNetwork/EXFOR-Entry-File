DETECTOR   (PLATE) Low sensitivity K0 Ilford emulsion, about      O0608  1   11 
           400-um thick, were loaded with different               O0608  1   12 
           elements under study. The beam direction was           O0608  1   13 
           perpendicular to the emulsion surface.                 O0608  1   14 
COMMENT    -By authors- We count as fission events only single    O0608  1   15 
           tracks with range >= 17 um.                            O0608  1   16 
SAMPLE     Uranium, thorium, and bismuth were loaded into the     O0608  1   17 
           emulsions.                                             O0608  1   18 
           Comment by compiler: the authors mentioned 238U        O0608  1   19 
           among the loaded nuclei. Most likely, 238 here means   O0608  1   20 
           not the pure isotope but the average atomic mass for   O0608  1   21 
           natural uranium loaded.                                O0608  1   22 
CORRECTION  Performed: Subtraction of background estimated from   O0608  1   23
