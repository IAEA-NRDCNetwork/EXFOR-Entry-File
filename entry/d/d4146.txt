SAMPLE     Targets were 7.5 micron thick high purity Nb foils fromD414600100009 
           Goodfellow.                                            D414600100010 
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) Stacked target technique was   D414600100011 
           applied. Beam current was measured in a Faraday-like   D414600100012 
           target holder. 9 microns of Al foils were used to      D414600100013 
           separate the Nb target foils. Al foils served as energyD414600100014 
           degraders and catcher foils. A Nb foil and the         D414600100015 
           following Al foil were measured together.              D414600100016 
           Irradiation was done at 10 MeV for 1 hour with 300-500 D414600100017 
           nA deuteron beam.                                      D414600100018

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) Energy uncertainty was calculated including   D414600100020 
           the uncertainty of the primary beam, the energy loss   D414600100021 
           and the straggling.                                    D414600100022
