SAMPLE     Uranium foils of thickness 71 mg/cm**2 covered with    D604400100012 
           6.75 mg/cm**2 thick superpure aluminium foils were     D604400100013 
           Irradiated with 40.0 p/m 0.4 MeV alpha particle beam   D604400100014 
           at VECC, Calcutta with beam current of 1.0-2.0 micro   D604400100015 
           ampere.                                                D604400100016 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The resultant precipitate of silver antiomonide,D604400100017 
           dissolved in dil. HNO3, was counted on a 45 cc HPGe    D604400100018 
           detector coupled to a 4 K MCA in live time. The        D604400100019 
           resolution of the detector was 2.2 keV at 1332 keV.    D604400100020 
           The  gamma spectra indicated that there was no         D604400100021 
           contamination from other fission products in the       D604400100022 
           separated antimony isotopes.                           D604400100023 
METHOD     (REC,RCHEM,GSPEC) After the irradiation, the front     D604400100024 
           side catcher of the irradiated target was dissolved    D604400100025 
           with NaOH in presence of antimony carrier. Antimony    D604400100026 
           was separated from the active solution by distilling   D604400100027 
           antimony hydride and collecting into silver nitrate    D604400100028 
           solution. The resultant precipitate of silver          D604400100029 
           antiomonide, dissolved in dil. HNO3, was counted on    D604400100030 
           a 45 cc HPGe detector coupled to a 4 K MCA in live     D604400100031 
           time mode.                                             D604400100032 
ANALYSIS   (AREA) From the photopeak areas of the gamma rays of   D604400100033 
           The nuclides' independent isomeric yields were         D604400100034 
           determined using usual decay-growth equations after    D604400100035 
           for correcting the precursor contribution.             D604400100036 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error on an individual measurement is   D604400100037 
           about 15 % which is the compounded error due to        D604400100038 
           counting statistics, the uncertainties on the          D604400100039 
           gamma-ray abundances, the fractional cumulative yield  D604400100040 
            (FCY) 128-Sn, the irradiation and separation  times   D604400100041 
           and the half lives. The errors quoted on the mean      D604400100042 
           isomeric yield ratios are the precision of the         D604400100043 
           measurements.                                          D604400100044

COMMENT    fragment angular momenta estimated from the measured   D604400100051 
           isomer ratios using the statistical model analysis     D604400100052 
           showed significantly larger fragment angular momenta   D604400100053 
           in the medium energy fissioning system compared to     D604400100054 
           the low energy fissioning system. This has been        D604400100055 
           attributed to the effect of higher excitation energy   D604400100056 
           and angular momentum in the entrance channel leading   D604400100057 
           to increased fragment temperature, moments of inertia  D604400100058 
           and angular velocity.                                  D604400100059
