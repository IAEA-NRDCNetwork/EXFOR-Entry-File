SAMPLE     Nine 208 mu-g/cm2 targets with aluminium degrades      D0209  1   11 
           in two different groups were irradiated.               D0209  1   12 
           Targets were of Os natural composition (184Os -0.02%,  D0209  1   13 
           186Os -1.58%, 187Os -1.6%, 188Os -13.3%,               D0209  1   14

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-spectrometry was carried out by       D0209  1   16 
           50 cm3 HPGe detectors connected to multichannel        D0209  1   17

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The decays of the different radionuclides have D0209  1   19 
           been followed for not less than three half-lives and   D0209  1   20 
           the length of measurements were chosen for each        D0209  1   21 
           radionuclide so that the counting statistical error on D0209  1   22 
           the photopeak areas was always of the order of less    D0209  1   23 
           than 1%. The cumulative statistical error on each thin D0209  1   24

           decay constant, integrated charge and detector         D0209  1   26

CORRECTION Systematic errors related to the stopping power        D0209  1   32
