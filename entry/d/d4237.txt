SAMPLE     Targets of nominally 1.0 g in weight with an area      D4237  1   10 
            thickness of 2.36 g/cm2 were prepared by compacting   D4237  1   11 
            anhydrous CsF powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in aD4237  1   12 
            punch-and-die set using a hydraulic press.            D4237  1   13

METHOD     (ACTIV,EDEG,EXTB,GSPEC,SITA)                           D4237  1   16 
           The target discs were thick enough to completely stop  D4237  1   17 
            the beam at the primary proton energy 17.5 MeV.       D4237  1   18 
           During bombardment, each target had a Cu monitor foil  D4237  1   19 
            in front with a nominal thickness of 0.025 mm.        D4237  1   20 
           The incident energy on target was adjusted by means of D4237  1   21 
            Al degrader foils of various thicknesses located      D4237  1   22 
            upstream from the monitor foils and targets.          D4237  1   23 
           Each bombardment lasted about 85 min at a beam current D4237  1   24 
            of nominally 50 nA.                                   D4237  1   25 
           The targets were bombarded in a small target holder    D4237  1   26 
            mounted on the end of an external beamline,           D4237  1   27 
            electrically insulated.                               D4237  1   28 
           As CsF is very hygroscopic, the targets were kept in a D4237  1   29 
            vacuum oven at a temperature of 150 C until shortly   D4237  1   30 
            before irradiation.                                   D4237  1   31 
           The targets were in a vacuum environment during        D4237  1   32 
            bombardment.                                          D4237  1   33 
           Following irradiation, each activated CsF disc was     D4237  1   34 
            dissolved in 3 mL of water in a standard glass serum  D4237  1   35 
            vial, that constituted the counting sources.          D4237  1   36 
           Two identical fractions of the 133Ba solution were     D4237  1   37 
            prepared into sources, a source having a point        D4237  1   38 
            geometry and the other made up into a 3 mL solution.  D4237  1   39 
           The two specially prepared 133Ba sources were identicalD4237  1   40 
            in strength.                                          D4237  1   41 
           The ratio of their respective detector responses       D4237  1   42 
            provided a correction factor for the different        D4237  1   43 
            counting geometry and the self-absorption in the      D4237  1   44 
            liquid volume and glass walls.                        D4237  1   45 
           Decay data were taken from Firestone and Eckstrom,     D4237  1   46

           (DATA-ERR) The total uncertainties in the measured     D4237  1   59 
            cross sections and yields were obtained by summing    D4237  1   60 
            all the contributing uncertainties in quadrature and  D4237  1   61 
            are expressed as standard uncertainties.              D4237  1   62 
           The uncertainties due to counting statistics and photo-D4237  1   63 
            peak integration were generally negligible <1%.       D4237  1   64 
           In the case of the liquid sources, an additional       D4237  1   65 
             uncertainty of 2% was adopted for the detector       D4237  1   66 
             efficiency, resulting from the experimental          D4237  1   67 
             correction factor for the source geometry.           D4237  1   68 
           The systematic uncertainty was estimated to be about   D4237  1   69 
            7%, including the                                     D4237  1   70
