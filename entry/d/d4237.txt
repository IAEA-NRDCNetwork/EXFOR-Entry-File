SAMPLE     Targets of nominally 1.0 g in weight with an areal     D423700100010 
            thickness of 2.36 g/cm2 were prepared by compacting   D423700100011 
            anhydrous CsF powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in aD423700100012 
            punch-and-die set using a hydraulic press.            D423700100013

           The target discs were thick enough to completely stop  D423700100017 
            the beam at the primary proton energy 17.5 MeV.       D423700100018 
           During bombardment, each target had a Cu monitor foil  D423700100019 
            in front with a nominal thickness of 0.025 mm.        D423700100020 
           The incident energy on target was adjusted by means of D423700100021 
            Al degrader foils of various thicknesses located      D423700100022 
            upstream from the monitor foils and targets.          D423700100023 
           Each bombardment lasted about 85 min at a beam current D423700100024 
            of nominally 50 nA.                                   D423700100025 
           The targets were bombarded in a small target holder    D423700100026 
            mounted on the end of an external beamline,           D423700100027 
            electrically insulated.                               D423700100028 
           As CsF is very hygroscopic, the targets were kept in a D423700100029 
            vacuum oven at a temperature of 150 C until shortly   D423700100030 
            before irradiation.                                   D423700100031 
           The targets were in a vacuum environment during        D423700100032 
            bombardment.                                          D423700100033 
           Following irradiation, each activated CsF disc was     D423700100034 
            dissolved in 3 mL of water in a standard glass serum  D423700100035 
            vial, that constituted the counting sources.          D423700100036 
           Two identical fractions of the 133Ba solution were     D423700100037 
            prepared into sources, a source having a point        D423700100038 
            geometry and the other made up into a 3 mL solution.  D423700100039 
           The two specially prepared 133Ba sources were identicalD423700100040 
            in strength.                                          D423700100041 
           The ratio of their respective detector responses       D423700100042 
            provided a correction factor for the different        D423700100043 
            counting geometry and the self-absorption in the      D423700100044 
            liquid volume and glass walls.                        D423700100045

            all the contributing uncertainties in quadrature and  D423700100061 
            are expressed as standard uncertainties.              D423700100062 
           The uncertainties due to counting statistics and photo-D423700100063 
            peak integration were generally negligible <1%.       D423700100064 
           In the case of the liquid sources, an additional       D423700100065 
             uncertainty of 2% was adopted for the detector       D423700100066 
             efficiency, resulting from the experimental          D423700100067 
             correction factor for the source geometry.           D423700100068 
           The systematic uncertainty was estimated to be about   D423700100069
