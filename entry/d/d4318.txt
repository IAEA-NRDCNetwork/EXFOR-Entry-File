SAMPLE     (68-ER-162,ENR=0.258)The targets were made by          D4318  1   11 
           reductive vacuum evaporation of Er2O3 powder enriched  D4318  1   12 
           to 25.8% in 162Er onto 2 mm thick, high purity Al      D4318  1   13 
           foils. The Er2O3 powder was mixed with Zr powder and   D4318  1   14 
           placed into a C crucible heated by electron beam. The  D4318  1   15 
           target thicknesses were between 114 and 188 mg/cm2.    D4318  1   16 
           The Zr contamination was always below 4 atom%.         D4318  1   17

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,SITA,EXTB) The reaction cross sections    D4318  1   19 
           of 162Er(a,g)166Yb and 162Er(a,n)165Yb were            D4318  1   20 
           determined in energy ranges Ecm=11.21-16.09MeV and     D4318  1   21 
           Ecm=12.19-16.09MeV respectively. In both cases         D4318  1   22 
           activation technique was used. After the irradiation,  D4318  1   23 
           a waiting time of 0.25 h was used. The activity of     D4318  1   24 
           targets was measured with a Low Energy Photon          D4318  1   25 
           Spectrometer (LEPS). Typical duration of the counting  D4318  1   26 
           was about 150-160 h. Due to the short half-life of     D4318  1   27 
           165Yb, the (a,n) cross section was determined from     D4318  1   28 
           the decay of its daughter (165Tm).                     D4318  1   29

           (ERR-T) The uncertainty of the cross section is        D4318  1   32 
           calculated as the quadratic sums of the following      D4318  1   33
