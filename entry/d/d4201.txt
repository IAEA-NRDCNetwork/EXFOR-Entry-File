METHOD     As 165Er has no gamma line, it was quantified by the   D420100200004 
           characteristic X-ray line of its decay product 165Ho.  D420100200005 
           The 165Er activity was determined from spectra         D420100200006 
           measured after the total decay of 161Er and 163Er,     D420100200007 
           ensuring that also the signals from the directly       D420100200008 
           produced 161-164Ho isomers had disappeared.            D420100200009 
           To determine the activities in addition to the well    D420100200010 
           known corrections for pile-up and background in the    D420100200011 
           low energy region, the self-absorption of the 165Ho    D420100200012 
           X-rays in the target material were also taken into     D420100200013
