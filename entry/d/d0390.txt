METHOD     (BCINT) The intensity of the beam was measured by a    D039000100008 
           Faraday cup, 25 cm long, kept under vacuum and         D039000100009 
           separated from the gas chamber by a thin nickel foil.  D039000100010 
SAMPLE     A gas target was used to make absolute measurements of D039000100011 
           the cross-section at various angles and energies of theD039000100012 
           incident particles. The pressure of the gas in the     D039000100013 
           scattering chamber was regulated by a differential     D039000100014 
           pumping system.                                        D039000100015 
           The 160 gas used as a target was  approx. 99% pure.    D039000100016 
DETECTOR   (SOLST)Four solid-state movable detectors were placed  D039000100017 
           inside the scattering chamber at intervals of 10 degr. D039000100018 
           from one another                                       D039000100019 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-DIG) Digitizing error                             D039000100020 
           (ERR-T) Total error on the absolute values of the      D039000100021 
           cross-sections. In the cross-section evaluation,       D039000100022 
           corrections were made to take into account the 14N     D039000100023 
           contamination. These corrections, in the case of the   D039000100024 
           elastic scattering were always less than 1 %.          D039000100025 
              * The Faraday-cup efficiency was estimated to be    D039000100026 
                 better than 99.0 %.                              D039000100027 
              * The accuracy of the charge integrator introduces aD039000100028 
                0.8 % uncertainty in the charge absolute value.   D039000100029 
              * The error in the geometrical factor was estimated D039000100030 
                to introduce a 3.5 % error in the absolute value  D039000100031 
                of the cross-section.                             D039000100032 
              * The errors in the temperature, pressure and chargeD039000100033 
                were taken into account.                          D039000100034 
              * very small uncertainty in the measurement         D039000100035 
                of the angle of the detectors.                    D039000100036 
           The statistical error is negligible for the elastic    D039000100037 
           scattering, while for (d, p) and (d, ao) reactions it  D039000100038 
           is of the order of a few per cent                      D039000100039 
           (EN-ERR) Energy spread. Since the target length, as    D039000100040 
           seen by the detectors through their collimators, was   D039000100041 
           always smaller than 3 cm, an energy spread smaller     D039000100042 
           than 15 keV at Ed. = 1.5 MeV                           D039000100043
