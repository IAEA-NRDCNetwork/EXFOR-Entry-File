ANALYSIS   A method is developed in which pulse-height spectra    D053600100015 
           from plastic scintillator are carefully analysed to    D053600100016 
           give the total number of low pulse height events       D053600100017 
           obtained with a mono-energetic incident beam.          D053600100018 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The thin dE/dx crystal was chosen for each      D053600100019 
           particular incident energy to give an energy loss of   D053600100020 
           300 keV, which produced a spectrum resolution of       D053600100021 
           about 25%. The material used was Nuclear Enterprise's  D053600100022 
           NE 102 plastic scintillator. The crystal was mounted   D053600100023 
           on an EMI 6097B photomultiplier.                       D053600100024 
           The full energy detector was also made of Ne 102,      D053600100025 
           7.6 cm in diameter by 3.8 cm thick and this was mated  D053600100026 
            to an EMI 6097F photomultiplier.                      D053600100027
