SAMPLE     natural metal Ti foils 1.8 mg/cm thick.                D407900100008 
           Al foils were used as energy degrader in the stack.    D407900100009 
           about 9 mg/cm2 vanadium pentoxid was prepared by       D407900100010 
           spattering onto thin Al foils.                         D407900100011 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,GSPEC) stacks were irradiated in vacuum.   D407900100012 
           beam current was monitored by Faraday-cup.             D407900100013 
           the recoil los was about 20% and the cross section was D407900100014 
           corrected for the recoil loss in the case of Ti        D407900100015 
           bombardment.                                           D407900100016

ANALYSIS   (AREA) normal NaI(Tl) gamma-spectrometry was applied   D407900100018 
           the energy loss in the Al energy degrader foils was    D407900100019

           the energy loss in the target foils was determined     D407900100023 
           using the bethe formula.                               D407900100024
