SAMPLE     The thin circular targets, approximately 1 cm in diam.,D017400100011 
           were mounted in a target wheel accommodating           D017400100012 
           13 targets and two empty space for target-out          D017400100013 
           measurements.                                          D017400100014 
METHOD     (EDE,EXTB,INTB) A series of target-in and target-out   D017400100015 
           measurements, each consisting of about 5 x 10**6       D017400100016 
           incident protons, was performed for each target.       D017400100017 
DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) Two thin passing scintillator         D017400100018 
           detectors worked in coincidence; two annular           D017400100019 
           scintillator detectors.                                D017400100020 
           (TELES,SCIN,CSICR) Beyond the target wheel was the     D017400100021 
           stopping detector telescope consisted:                 D017400100022 
            - a set of three plastic scintillator detectors.      D017400100023 
           The first was circular with a diameter of 5.24 mm,     D017400100024 
           while the second and third detectors were ring shaped  D017400100025 
           with inner and outer diameters of 4.30 and 7.35mm and  D017400100026 
           6.65 and 8.77 mm, respectively.                        D017400100027 
           - two CsI-detectors mounted together.                  D017400100028 
CORRECTION  * Various corrections were made on elastic            D017400100029 
           scattering that did not registed by detectors used     D017400100030 
           in the experiment (see the text of the paper).         D017400100031 
            * The results were also corrected for the limited     D017400100032 
           angular acceptance of the detector system.             D017400100033 
            * Corrections due to finite target thickness and      D017400100034 
           finite beam size were estimated to be negligible.      D017400100035
