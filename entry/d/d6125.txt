SAMPLE     A self supporting 1.8 mg/cm**2 thick 232Th target      D612500100011 
DETECTOR   (PS,MWPC) Two low pressure X-Y position sensitive      D612500100012 
            multiwire avalanche counters of Breskin-type, having  D612500100013 
            active dimensions of 6.5 cm x 5.0 cm and 15 cm x      D612500100014 
            3.5 cm, were mounted on either side of the fissile    D612500100015 
            target for detecting the complementary fission        D612500100016 
            fragments in coincidence.                             D612500100017 
           The position sensitive detectors were kept at 14 cm    D612500100018 
            and 12 cm, respectively, from the target subtending   D612500100019 
            the in-plane angles of about 26 deg and 63 deg,       D612500100020 
            respectively, at the target.                          D612500100021 
           The detectors were moved to different specified angles D612500100022 
            (33 deg, 200 deg), (75 deg, 253 deg) with respect to  D612500100023 
            beam direction to carry out the measurements over a   D612500100024 
            large angular range.                                  D612500100025 
           The detectors were operated with isobutane gas at torr D612500100026 
            pressure.                   D6125  1   30             D612500100027 
           (SI) A 500 micron-thick semiconductor detector was     D612500100028 
            placed at 25 deg at a distance of 40 cm from the      D612500100029 
            target to monitor the elastically scattered heavy     D612500100030 
            ions for normalization purposes.                      D612500100031 
METHOD     (COINC) Fusion-fission and transfer fission events     D612500100032 
            were separated by folding angle technique and the     D612500100033 
            fission cross sections have been measured employing   D612500100034 
            the kinematic coincidence.                            D612500100035 
           The time of arrival of the fragments at the two        D612500100036 
            position sensitive detectors and the X and Y position D612500100037 
            pulses from the two detectors were recorded event by  D612500100038 
            event in list mode.                                   D612500100039

ANALYSIS   (INTAD) The angle calibration of the fission fragment  D612500100041 
            detectors was achieved from the observed dips in the  D612500100042 
            fragment yields in the detectors due to the shadowing D612500100043 
            caused by the wires used to support the thin windows  D612500100044 
            of the PSDs.                                          D612500100045 
           This calibration was done using a 252Cf source mounted D612500100046 
            at the point of the target location.                  D612500100047 
           The coincidence timing information from the two        D612500100048 
            fission fragment detectors was recorded as one of the D612500100049 
            parameters to select the genuine fission events time  D612500100050 
            difference between the two FFs <20 ns and thus helped D612500100051 
            to reject random coincidences.                        D612500100052 
           From the event-by-event information on the position of D612500100053 
            the two complementary fragments in the two detectors, D612500100054 
            their angles of emission were calculated.             D612500100055 
           The measured folding angle distributions at different  D612500100056 
            bombarding energies were fitted with three            D612500100057 
            Gaussian peaks corresponding to fusion-fission,       D612500100058 
            transfer fission and low momentum transfer fission    D612500100059 
            events.                                               D612500100060
