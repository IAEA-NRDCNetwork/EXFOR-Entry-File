           The absence of all oxides could be confirmed.          D419800100015 
           The osmium deposit was covered by a 10 micron thick Al D419800100016 
            foil. Monitor foils: Ti and Cu (both >99.6% pure)     D419800100017 
            with thicknesses of 10 and 25 micron.                 D419800100018 
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)                                D419800100019 
           Several stacks consisting of a few 192Os samples and   D419800100020 
            thin Ti and Cu monitor foils were irradiated.         D419800100021 
           Primary alpha energy: 28 MeV.                          D419800100022 
           The beam flux was measured by charge integration as    D419800100023 
            well as via monitor reactions.                        D419800100024 
           A chemical separation procedure was applied to isolate D419800100025 
            the radioplatinum from the background activity, thus  D419800100026 
            enabling the preparation of a clean and thin source   D419800100027 
            suitable for X-ray counting.                          D419800100028 
           The yield of radiochemical separation was between 60%  D419800100029 
            and 90%. The gamma-ray analysis also showed that the  D419800100030 
            contamination of radioplatinum by non-isotopic        D419800100031 
            radionuclidic impurities (56,58Co, 65Zn, etc.) was    D419800100032
