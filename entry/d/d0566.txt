FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) TWINSOL radioactive nuclear beam        D056600100009 
           facility at the University of Notre Dame. The main     D056600100010 
           components of the TWINSOL facility are a couple of     D056600100011 
           big superconducting solenoids, six teslas each one,    D056600100012 
           used to collect, transport, and analyze the            D056600100013 
           secondary RNB that can be focused on a secondary       D056600100014 
           target.                                                D056600100015 
INC-SOURCE To produce the 8B RNB, a 6Li primary beam was used,    D056600100016 
           incident on a 3He gas target at a pressure of 1 atm.   D056600100017 
           The secondary beam flux was calibrated by inserting    D056600100018 
           a Si dE-E telescope at the secondary target position   D056600100019 
           and reducing the intensity of the primary beam by      D056600100020 
           three orders of magnitude so that the 8B ions could    D056600100021 
           be directly counted, while at the same time the        D056600100022 
           primary beam current was measured in a Faraday cup.    D056600100023 
SAMPLE     The secondary target was a 58Ni high-purity foil,      D056600100024 
           with a thickness of 0.924 mg/cm2.                      D056600100025 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Breakup events were detected with two          D056600100026 
           silicon dE-E telescopes placed at angle 45 degr.       D056600100027
