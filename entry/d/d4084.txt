SAMPLE     Gas cells filled with natural krypton to a pressure    D408400100010 
           of 1-2 bar absolute.                                   D408400100011 
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)                                D408400100012 
           Natural krypton was irradiated in stacked gas cells    D408400100013 
           windowed 15 micron kapton. Primary deuteron energies   D408400100014 
           were 14.2 9.9, 9.7 and 7.4 MeV.                        D408400100015 
           Beam current 0.1 microamp. Ti and Fe monitors were usedD408400100016 
           21 and 12 micron thick respectivelly.                  D408400100017 
           Charge integrated by Faraday-Cup.  Nuclear             D408400100018 
           data were taken from E.Brwne and R.B.Firestone Table   D408400100019 
           of Radioactive Isotopes Ed.V.S.Shirley, Wiley 1986.    D408400100020 
           The mean energy in the monitor foils and in the gas    D408400100021 
           cells were calculated using tables of H.H.Andersen,    D408400100022

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The Error of the energy was calculated taking  D408400100025 
           into account the initial uncertainty the sraggling of  D408400100026 
           the beam and the errors in the thickness of the targetsD408400100027 
           The estimated energy scale error was +-0.3 MeV at the  D408400100028 
           first cell and +-0.7 MeV at the last cell in the stack.D408400100029 
           (ERR-T) The error of the cross section data were       D408400100030 
           estimated by summing up the squares of the individual  D408400100031 
           relative errors and taking the square root of it.      D408400100032 
           Detector efficiency was  5%. The overall uncertainty   D408400100033 
           reached  13%.                                          D408400100034
