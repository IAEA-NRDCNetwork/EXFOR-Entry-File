SAMPLE     A self-supporting thorium target of thickness 2.0      D607500100012 
           Mg/cm**2 was bombarded with a 6-Li beam.               D607500100013 
DETECTOR   (SOLST,SISD) a solid state delta E - E telescope of    D607500100014 
           thickness 150.0 micro millimeter to 1.0 millimeter was D607500100015 
           kept at 90 degree with respect to the beam direction   D607500100016 
           around the transfer grazing angle to identify the      D607500100017 
           projectile-like-fragments (PLF). A 16 strip solid      D607500100018 
           state detector (each strip of size 2.0 X 64.0 mm) was  D607500100019 
           placed at a back angle covering the laboratory angular D607500100020 
           range of 141-158 degree to detect fission fragments in D607500100021 
           coincidence with PLFs.                                 D607500100022 
METHOD     (EDE) The proton, deuteron, triton, alpha and 6-Li     D607500100023 
           particles are uniquely identified by plotting delta    D607500100024 
           E against the delta E + E. This plot was transformed   D607500100025 
           to create an effective particle identification versus  D607500100026 
           energy plot.                                           D607500100027 
INC-SOURCE A self-supporting thorium was bombarded with 6-Li      D607500100028

ANALYSIS   (SURGT) The 234-Pa and 236-U compound systems have     D607500100031 
           been populated at overlapping excitation energies in   D607500100032 
           the same experiment through 232-Th (6-Li,A) 234-Pa and D607500100033 
           232-Th (6-Li,D) 236-U transfer channels at E (lab) = 38D607500100034 
           MeV, and the absolute surrogate method is used to      D607500100035 
           determine fission decay probabilities of the above     D607500100036 
           compound nuclei by dividing the number of PLF-fission  D607500100037 
           coincidences by the associated PLF-singles data. The   D607500100038 
           experimental values of fission decay probability       D607500100039 
           ratios of 234-Pa and 236-U compound nuclei at the same D607500100040 
           excitation energies have been used to deduce the 233-PaD607500100041 
            (n,f) cross-section using a surrogate ratio approach. D607500100042 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The uncertainties shown in the measured cross  D607500100043 
           section is due to the statistics of coincidence        D607500100044 
           counts in each energy beam.                            D607500100045 
COMMENT    A new hybrid surrogate ratio approach has been         D607500100046 
           employed to determine neutron-induced fission cross    D607500100047 
           sections of 233-Pa in the energy range of 11.5 to      D607500100048 
           16.5 MeV for the first time. The 233-Pa                D607500100049 
           (n,f) cross sections are deduced from the measured     D607500100050 
           fission decay probabilities ratios of 234-Pa and       D607500100051 
           236-U compound nuclei using the surrogate ratio        D607500100052 
           method. The 233-Pa (n,f) cross section data from the   D607500100053 
           present experiment along with the data from the        D607500100054 
           literature, covering the neutron energy range of 1.0   D607500100055 
           to 16.5 MeV have been compared with the predictions    D607500100056 
           of statistical model code EMPIRE-2.19. While the       D607500100057 
           present data are consistent with the model             D607500100058 
           predictions, there is a discrepancy between the        D607500100059 
           earliear experiment data and EMPIRE-2.19 predictions   D607500100060 
           in the neutron energy range of 7.0 to 10.0 MeV.        D607500100061
