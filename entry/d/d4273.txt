SAMPLE     (53-I-127,NAT=100) For target production a KI          D427300100015 
           compound was used. The targets were made by vacuum     D427300100016 
           evaporation from  a Mo boat onto 2 micron thick        D427300100017 
           aluminum foils. The thickness of the KI targets was    D427300100018 
           between 106 and 507 micro-g/cm2, corresponding to aboutD427300100019 
           5.3 E17 and 24.0E 17 I atoms/cm2.                      D427300100020 
DETECTOR   (HPGE,LEGE)                                            D427300100021 
METHOD     (SITA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC) The KI targets were irradiated D427300100022 
           with alpha beams from the MGC20 cyclotron of ATOMKI.   D427300100023 
           Energies were in the range of 9.81 <= Ea<=15.5 MeV,    D427300100024 
           covered in steps of about 0.5 MeV.                     D427300100025 
           The typical beam current was between 0.1 and 0.6 microAD427300100026 
           The length of each irradiation was between 0.92 and    D427300100027 
           24 h, corresponding to about 2.7 E15 and 2.7 E17 total D427300100028 
           incident alpha particles.                              D427300100029 
           The current integrator counts were recorded in         D427300100030 
           multichannel scaling mode, stepping the channel every  D427300100031 
           minute to take into account the changes in the beam    D427300100032 
           current.                                               D427300100033 
ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR)The quoted uncertainty in the Ec.m. values     D427300100034 
           corresponds to the energy  stability of the beam and   D427300100035 
           to the uncertainty of the energy loss in the target.   D427300100036 
           (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of the cross section is the D427300100037 
           quadratic sum of the following partial errors:         D427300100038 
           (ERR-1)HPGE detector efficiency(6%);                   D427300100039

           (ERR-4) current measurement (3%);                      D427300100042 
           (ERR-5,,13.2) uncertainty of decay parameters (<=13.2);D427300100043 
           (ERR-S,1.6,17.9) counting statistics (1.6-17.9%).      D427300100044 
           The uncertainties given for the averaged values are theD427300100045 
           variances of the weighted means.                       D427300100046
