           Pr2O3 and CeO2 samples were prepared by sedimentation  D418700100014 
           onto 25 micron thick Cu backing. 30 - 60 minutes       D418700100015 
           irradiations were applied. The prmary 3He energies wereD418700100016 
           27.7 and 36.9 MeV. Primary proton energies were 20 and D418700100017 
           45 MeV. Monitor foils were used to check the beam      D418700100018 
           current and beam energy.                               D418700100019 
           Irradiations were done at the CV28 and at COSY         D418700100020

           Gamma-spectara were recorded several times to          D418700100022 
           check the half life and follow the decay. Detector     D418700100023 
           sample distance was about 10 cm.                       D418700100024

ERR-ANALYS The individual uncertainties of the cross sections and D418700100029 
           cross section ratios were combined in quadrature,      D418700100030 
           taking into account the correlation of the data, to    D418700100031 
           obtain an overall uncertainty of 9-31% and 9-50% for   D418700100032 
           the cross sections and for the isomeric cross-section  D418700100033
