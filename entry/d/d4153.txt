SAMPLE     Targets were high purity natural Pd foils of 12.14 and D415300100009 
           7.99 microns from GoodFellow.                          D415300100010 
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC)                                D415300100011 
           Stacked target technique was used. Initial energies:   D415300100012 
           20.5 and 15.1 MeV for deuterons and 37.3, 28.5 and     D415300100013 
           15.9 MeV for protons.                                  D415300100014 
           Ti, Cu and Ni were used as monitor foils.              D415300100015 
           Beam intensity was 100-200nA and was also measured in  D415300100016 
           Faraday cup.                                           D415300100017 
           Five irradiations were done.                           D415300100018 
           High resolution gamma spectrometry was applied without D415300100019 
           chemical separation. Spectra were measured after the   D415300100020 
           total decay of the short lived isomer states.          D415300100021 
           Energy degradation was calculated by using the         D415300100022 
           polynomial approximation of Andersen and Ziegler.      D415300100023 
           Energy scale and beam intensity along the stacks were  D415300100024 
           corrected according to the applied monitor reactions.  D415300100025 
           Decay data were taken from R.B. Firestone              D415300100026
