SAMPLE     targets were Al, V, Nb and Au foils. The impurities    D403600100010 
           of the foils were given in B.Scholten et al. RCA,62,   D403600100011

           inpurities were also given. Cu and Al foils serve as   D403600100013 
           monitor and enery degrader foils. Thick foils (50-     D403600100014 
           500 micron) were place between two thin (10-25 micron) D403600100015 
           catcher foils of the same material.                    D403600100016 
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,CHSEP)a thick stack was irradiated    D403600100017 
           with 99 MeV protons for about 4 hours at beam current  D403600100018 
           of 100 Na in Uppsala. Several thin stacks were irradia-D403600100019 
           ted in Juelich for about 12 hours with 45 MeV protons  D403600100020 
           at a beam current of 0.5 To 2.0 Microamps.             D403600100021 
           the energy of the primary beam in Uppsala was          D403600100022 
           determined via measurements of ratio of activities     D403600100023 
           from known high threshold reactions. Al-27(p,x)Na-22   D403600100024

           the beam energy along the stacks was calculated        D403600100027 
           according to the range-energy formula of C.F.          D403600100028 
           Williamson et al. (Report CEA-R-3042, 1966) and was    D403600100029 
           checked by flux constancy (+- 3%) the beam intensity   D403600100030 
           was determined by Faraday cup and by using monitor     D403600100031 
           reactions (+-12% agreement) the Al-27(p,Be-7) process  D403600100032 
           was studied without chemical sep. Chemical sep. was    D403600100033 
           applied in the case of V, Nb and Au foils. The         D403600100034 
           radiochemical yield were about 85 - 97 % for the Be-7. D403600100035

           to the formation of Be-7 in the case of Al and Nb is   D403600100056 
           within the limit of experimental error, and about      D403600100057 
           50% for V target foils. In the case of Au samples      D403600100058
