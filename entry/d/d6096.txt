SAMPLE     Thin self supporting yttrium foils of 3 and 3.8mg/cm2  D609600100011 
           thickness were prepared by proper rolling. Target foilsD609600100012 
           and aluminium catcher foils MERCK of 1.5mg/cm2         D609600100013 
           thickness were mounted on aluminum ring of 10 mm inner D609600100014 
           and 22 mm outer diameter with 0.5 mm thickness. Target D609600100015 
           stack was assembled by 5 foils of yttrium each         D609600100016

INC-SOURCE Target stack thus prepared was bombarded with 9Be4+    D609600100028 
           ions of current less than 25 nA beam current for 3.75  D609600100029 
           h with a total charge of 304 muC measured with a       D609600100030 
           current integrator. Terminal voltage of the Pelletron  D609600100031 
           was maintained at 10.9MV that yielded a maximum        D609600100032 
           energy of 47.5MeV.Energy range covered was from        D609600100033 
           30-48MeV. The total                                    D609600100034 
           charge of irradiation was collected from an electron   D609600100035 
           suppressed Faraday cup stationed at the rear of the    D609600100036

           Activated foils were measured for 300 seconds in the   D609600100041 
           live time mode and successive measurements were carriedD609600100042 
           out in the same geometry. The projectile energy at a   D609600100043 
           target is calculated as the average                    D609600100044
