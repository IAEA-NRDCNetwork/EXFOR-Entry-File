SAMPLE     Thin layers of enriched molybdenum oxide (100MoO3)     D423500100013 
           targets (10 mm diameter) were prepared using the       D423500100014 
           sedimentation technique. A small amount of very fine   D423500100015 
           100MoO3 powder (99.9% pure) was suspended in vinyl     D423500100016 
           acetate (LEVAPREN 450), dissolved in carbon            D423500100017 
           tetrachloride and slowly sedimented onto an aluminium  D423500100018 
           foil backing having 13.0 mm diameter and 92 um         D423500100019 
           thickness. The 100MoO3 sample was then covered by a    D423500100020 
           13 um thick polyimide (Kapton) foil for protection.    D423500100021 
           The thickness of the sedimented 100MoO3 layer varied   D423500100022 
           between 2.24 and 6.23 mg/cm2.                          D423500100023

           Four stacks were irradiated with deuterons.            D423500100033 
           Irradiation time: about 0.5 h,                         D423500100034 
           beam intensity: 40 nA,                                 D423500100035 
           beam energies: 30 MeV and 50 MeV.                      D423500100036 
           Each stack contained 10 foils; the Al backings served  D423500100037 
           as degraders and monitors.                             D423500100038 
           The beam currents were kept constant during the        D423500100039 
           irradiations and were measured with a Faraday-cup.     D423500100040 
           The activities of the irradiated foils were measured   D423500100041 
           without chemical separation with high resolution       D423500100042 
           gamma-ray spectroscopy.                                D423500100043 
           The decays of the produced radioisotopes were followed D423500100044 
           by measuring each sample several times.                D423500100045 
           A minimal cooling time of 4 h was introduced before    D423500100046 
           the first gamma-spectra measurements due to the        D423500100047 
           transportation from the irradiation place.             D423500100048

COMMENT    By the authors.                                        D423500200004 
           a) Corrections were made to eliminate contributions    D423500200005 
           from 140.5 keV (4.52%) and 141.2 keV (66.8%) gamma-    D423500200006 
           lines of 99Mo and 90Nb, respectively, and to eliminate D423500200007 
           contribution caused by decay of 99Mo. In the first two D423500200008 
           cases, peak areas of independent gamma-lines of 99Mo   D423500200009 
           and 90Nb (739.5 keV, 12.13% and 1129.2 keV, 92.7%)     D423500200010 
           were considered to estimate the contributions to peak  D423500200011 
           area of the 140.5 keV line.                            D423500200012 
           b) According to the theoretical predictions,           D423500200013 
           contribution of the 98Mo(d,n)99mTc reaction taking     D423500200014 
           place on the small amount of 98Mo (3.6%) in the        D423500200015 
           enriched target can be neglected. This statement is    D423500200016 
           made in spite of the fact that the theoretical codes   D423500200017 
           used in this work cannot give excellent predictions.   D423500200018 
           The effect of the 98Mo(d,p)99Mo->99mTc process was     D423500200019 
           considered when peak area and cross section of 99Mo,   D423500200020 
           both uncorrected yet to the contribution of the        D423500200021 
           reaction taking place on 98Mo, was used for the        D423500200022 
           correction detailed in (a).                            D423500200023 
           c) The effect of the 97Mo(d,g) reaction was neglected. D423500200024

           99Mo originates from 100Mo(d,p2n) reaction and can be  D423500300005 
           produced by feeding via the 99Zr (2.1 s) ->            D423500300006 
           99Nb (metastable state 2.6 min, ground state 15.0 s)   D423500300007 
           decay chain. However, the probability of parent        D423500300008 
           production is negligible according to the TENDL-2009   D423500300009 
           prediction. Therefore, independent cross section was   D423500300010 
           measured in the investigated energy range.             D423500300011 
           The contribution of the 98Mo(d,p)99Mo reaction was     D423500300012 
           subtracted in the following way. The uncorrected curve D423500300013 
           had a bump with maximum of 60 mb at about 14 MeV       D423500300014 
           caused by the (d,p) reaction. As the ALICE-D code can  D423500300015 
           describe the (d,p) process, this bump was fitted with  D423500300016 
           a curve characteristic of (d,p) reaction. The fitted   D423500300017 
           cross sections were subtracted from the measured ones  D423500300018 
           which resulted in the disappearance of the bump and    D423500300019 
           somewhat lower cross sections above 19 MeV.            D423500300020

COMMENT    By the authors.                                        D423500500004 
           The excitation function was measured after total decay D423500500005 
           of the shorter lived metastable state.                 D423500500006 
           Although the theoretical codes cannot give excellent   D423500500007 
           predictions, the effect of interfering reactions       D423500500008 
           taking place on target nuclei other than 100Mo and the D423500500009 
           effect of interfering decay were estimated by means of D423500500010 
           the TENDL-2009. The interfering reactions such as      D423500500011 
           98Mo(d,2pn)97Nb and 97Mo(d,2p)97Nb on 3.6% 98Mo and    D423500500012 
           on 1.0% 97Mo as well as the disturbing decay coming    D423500500013 
           from 97Zr populated by the reactions taking place on   D423500500014 
           100Mo and 98Mo target nuclei, are negligible.          D423500500015 
           Therefore an independent cross section was measured.   D423500500016
