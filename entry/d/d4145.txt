SAMPLE     Target was solid boron nitride BN samples 0.2 mm thick.D414500100012 
           Al foils micron thick were used as energy degrader.    D414500100013 
METHOD     (ACTIV,EXTB,STTA,GSPEC) BN samples were irradiated withD414500100014 
           30-170nA beam at 26 MeV for 3 minutes.                 D414500100015 
           The beam current was measured in Faraday cup and was   D414500100016 
           also monitored with Cu foils. No numerical monitor     D414500100017 
           values were given in the article.                      D414500100018 
           Decay was followed for several half life to identify   D414500100019 
           the produced radioisotopes.                            D414500100020 
           The energy degradation was calculated by the method of D414500100021 
           Williamson (1966). Decay data were taken from Browne   D414500100022 
           and Firestone (1986).                                  D414500100023 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curve analysis of the annihilation peak  D414500100024 
           was applied.                                           D414500100025
