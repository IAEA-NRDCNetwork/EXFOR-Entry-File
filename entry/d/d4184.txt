METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,EXTB,GSPEC)                                D418400100014 
           Two stacks of natural erbium and two stacks of natural D418400100015 
           ytterbium target foils were irradiated, each           D418400100016 
           interlarded with Ti monitor foils. At the beginning of D418400100017 
           one of the two stacks an Al degrader foil was placed   D418400100018 
           to ensure a small energy shift.                        D418400100019 
           Incident alpha energies: 37.5, 37.9, 38.5 and 39.0 MeV,D418400100020 
           beam currents: 119.5, 108.8, 136.9 and 127.6 nA,       D418400100021 
           irradiation times:  2.00, 2.58, 1.55 and 1.58 hours    D418400100022 
           in the case of the two erbium and two ytterbium stacks,D418400100023 
           respectively.                                          D418400100024 
           No chemical separation.                                D418400100025 
           The gamma spectra of the target foils were registered  D418400100026 
           by a PC-coupled HPGe detector system just after the    D418400100027 
           end of bombardment and again a month later to get      D418400100028 
           information for the radionuclei of short and long      D418400100029 
           half-life as well and to follow cumulative processes.  D418400100030

           The sample-detector distance was chosen carefully to   D418400100032 
           avoid pile-up effects and coincidence losses. The      D418400100033 
           detector efficiency was determined placing standard    D418400100034 
           sources at different distances from the detector.      D418400100035

           The mean bombarding energy of the beam in the          D418400100039 
           subsequent foils was calculated following the          D418400100040

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The energy uncertainty of the beam at the     D418400100046 
           first foil is 0.3 MeV which increases along the stack  D418400100047 
           due to the energy straggling and the uncertainty of    D418400100048 
           target thicknesses and reaches 1.5 MeV at the last     D418400100049 
           foil.                                                  D418400100050 
           (ERR-T) The uncertainties of the cross sections were   D418400100051 
           determined in the standard way: the linearly           D418400100052 
           contributing independent processes were taken into     D418400100053 
           account extracting square root of quadratically summed D418400100054 
           relative uncertainties, namely:                        D418400100055 
            * number of the bombarding particles (7%),            D418400100056

            * decay data (3%),                                    D418400100058 
            * detector efficiency (7%) and                        D418400100059 
            * peak area (1-10%).                                  D418400100060
