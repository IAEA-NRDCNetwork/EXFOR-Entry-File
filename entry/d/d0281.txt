SAMPLE     The target was a 75 mu-g/cm2 thickness self-supported  D028100100013 
           evaporated 27Al foil.                                  D028100100014 
METHOD     The total fusion cross section has been measured  at   D028100100015 
           energies close and above the Coulomb barrier.          D028100100016 
           Different processes following the breakup should be    D028100100017 
           considered: elastic breakup (EBU), when neither of the D028100100018 
           breakup fragments is captured by the target;           D028100100019 
           incomplete fusion reaction (ICF), when one of the      D028100100020 
           fragments is captured by the target; and complete      D028100100021 
           fusion following breakup (CFBU), when all breakup      D028100100022 
           fragments are captured by the target.                  D028100100023 
           The sum of complete fusion (including two body         D028100100024 
           fusion and complete fusion following breakup) and      D028100100025 
           incomplete fusion is called total fusion.              D028100100026

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error. The normalization of the fusion   D028100200008 
           cross sections was obtained by counting elastic        D028100200009 
           scattering events in the spectra, when the experimentalD028100200010 
           conditions were such that the scattering was purely    D028100200011 
           Rutherford. Otherwise, it was obtained using the       D028100200012 
           integrated beam current in the Faraday cup and the     D028100200013 
           nominal target thickness. In the first case, the       D028100200014 
           associated uncertainty was around 2%, whereas in the   D028100200015 
           latter it was the sum of three contributions:          D028100200016 
           around 2% from the integrated beam current, 10% from   D028100200017
