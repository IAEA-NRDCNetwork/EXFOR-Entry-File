SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched tin targets having 3.95%         D051800100011 
           116Sn, 90% 117Sn, 3.81% 118Sn, 1.71% 119Sn, and        D051800100012 
           0.53% 120Sn in the form of self-supporting foils of    D051800100013 
           ~4.5 mg/cm2 were used in this experiment. The highly   D051800100014 
           enriched 117Sn targets were prepared via mechanical    D051800100015 
           rolling. The 117Sn foils were mounted on circular Al   D051800100016 
           holders with a hole diameter of 12 mm. A stack was     D051800100017 
           prepared having three 117Sn targets alternating with   D051800100018 
           aluminum foils of thickness ~5.5 mg/cm2. A titanium    D051800100019 
           foil of 3 mg/cm2 was placed at the end of the stack.   D051800100020 
           The aluminum foils served as incident alpha-beam       D051800100021 
           energy degraders and as catchers for recoil nuclei     D051800100022 
           from the 117Sn foils to estimate the recoil            D051800100023 
           fraction. In the first experiment,a stack of three     D051800100024 
           117Sn foils interspaced by two aluminum foils ended    D051800100025 
           with a Ti foil were irradiated with a 15 MeV 4He2+     D051800100026 
           beam.In the second experiment a stack consisting of a  D051800100027 
           117Sn foil followed by a Ti one was irradiated with a  D051800100028 
           15.6MeV 4He2+ beam.                                    D051800100029
