SAMPLE     The target face consists of ? curved depression of     D049400100010 
           approx. 10.2 x 2.1 cm, the surface of which was        D049400100011 
           coated with bismuth. Target backing plates             D049400100012 
           fabricated of aluminum and copper were evaluated.      D049400100013 
           Aluminum-backed targets were prepared by heating the   D049400100014 
           aluminum on a hot plate and adding bismuth metal       D049400100015 
           powder (99.9% purity). After melting, the bismuth      D049400100016 
           was distributed as evenly as possible with a           D049400100017
