SAMPLE     (64-GD-152,ENR=0.306) Isotopically enriched 152Gd      D4329  1   11 
           targets were produced by vacuum evaporation onto high  D4329  1   12 
           purity thin aluminum backings (2.5 micron) using Gd2O3 D4329  1   13 
           powder. The thickness of the targets varied between    D4329  1   14 
           0.220 mg/cm2 and 0.310 mg/cm2, determined by weight    D4329  1   15 
           measurement. Targets with thickness of 0.310 mg/cm2    D4329  1   16 
           were also examined by Rutherford back scattering       D4329  1   17 
           method.                                                D4329  1   18

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,EDEG,SITA,EXTB) The reaction cross        D4329  1   20 
           sections of 152Gd(p,g)153Tb and 152Gd(p,n)152Tb were   D4329  1   21 
           determined at beam energies E=3.5-8.0 MeV and          D4329  1   22 
           E=5.0-8.0 MeV respectively by using activation         D4329  1   23 
           technique. During the irradiation the target           D4329  1   24 
           stability was monitored by an ion-implanted Si         D4329  1   25 
           detector, placed at 165deg relative to the beam        D4329  1   26 
           direction. Typical beam current was 2 uA. After each   D4329  1   27 
           irradiation the target was transported to a            D4329  1   28 
           low-background counting setup. The activity of         D4329  1   29 
           targets was measured with a 100% relative efficiency   D4329  1   30
