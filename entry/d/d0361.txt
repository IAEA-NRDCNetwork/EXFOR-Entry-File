MONITOR    The collimated alpha-particle beam was monitored by    D036100100010 
           the charge collection method, using Faradays cup,      D036100100011 
           kept behind the target stack and coupled to a          D036100100012 
           current integrator.                                    D036100100013 
SAMPLE     Targets were made by depositing specpure Pr6O11 of     D036100100014 
           thickness 5 mg/cm2 on aluminum backing of uniform      D036100100015 
           thickness 6.75 mg/cm2 by vacuum evaporation technique. D036100100016 
           The aluminium backing served as energy degrader for    D036100100017 
           alpha-particle.                                        D036100100018

           (ERR-T) Total error. The factors likely to introduce   D036100100023 
           errors in the present measurements and their estimates D036100100024 
           are given as:                                          D036100100025 
            (i) Targets of different dimensions were weighted on  D036100100026 
                an electronic balance and numbers of nuclei       D036100100027 
                present in the target were measured. The          D036100100028 
                uncertainty in the estimate of number of target   D036100100029 
                nuclei is expected to be less than 1 %.           D036100100030 
            (ii) Error in the fluctuations of the beam current    D036100100031 
                has been incorporated by taking the weighted      D036100100032 
                average of aplha-paricle beam current and is      D036100100033 
                found to be less than 5%.                         D036100100034 
            (iii) The error introduced in the determination       D036100100035 
                of the photo-peak area of the characteristic      D036100100036 
                gamma-rays were limited within 2-5%.              D036100100037 
            (iv) The error due to uncertainty in detector         D036100100038 
                eft1ciency was estimated to be less than 5%.      D036100100039 
            (v) The errors due to decrease in beam intensity due  D036100100040 
               to scattering while alpha-particle beam traverses  D036100100041 
                through the stack is estimared to be less than 1%.D036100100042 
            (vi) The inherent uncertainty in the energy of the    D036100100043 
                alpha-particle beam, i.e., O.5MeV at 50 MeV       D036100100044 
                alpha-particle and the energy spread associated   D036100100045 
                with the thickness of each target in the stack    D036100100046 
                contributes < 4% to the alpha-particle energy.    D036100100047 
            (vii) Error associated with the straggling of the     D036100100048 
                alpha-particle is estimated to be negligibly smallD036100100049
