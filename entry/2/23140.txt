ANALYSIS    The neutron capture cross sections involving the      2314000400008 
           contributions of both 107Pd and other Pd isotopes were 2314000400009 
           derived in the energy range from 0.01 eV to 300 eV from2314000400010 
           the obtained TOF spectra relative to the cross sections2314000400011 
           of 10B. The relative cross sections were normalized to 2314000400012 
           the values calculated by the SAMMY code with JENDL-4.0 2314000400013 
           at the three energy points: 6.8 eV of 107Pd, 11.8 eV of2314000400014 
           105Pd, and 33 eV of 108Pd.                             2314000400015 
           The cross sections of 107Pd in the low energy region   2314000400016 
           were derived as follows:                               2314000400017 
           - the cross sections of Pd isotopes except for 107Pd   2314000400018 
           were calculated with the resonance parameters in       2314000400019 
           JENDL-4.0,                                             2314000400020 
           - the cross-section components for those Pd isotopes   2314000400021 
           were subtracted from the result for sample,            2314000400022 
           - the remained components were divided by the abundance2314000400023 
           of 107Pd in the sample.                                2314000400024

           The obtained cross-section curve in the thermal energy 2314000400026

COMMENT    Of authors.                                            2314000500010 
           The value in JENDL-4.0 is 0.01 meV, which is about five2314000500011 
           times larger than the present result.                  2314000500012 
           We found that both the 3.9-eV and 5.2-eV resonances do 2314000500013 
           not belong to 107Pd.                                   2314000500014
