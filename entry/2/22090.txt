INC-SOURCE (D-T) A Ti-T target mounted on a 50 cm diameter        22090  1   16 
            rotating target water cooled copper disc. Irradiations22090  1   17 
            were performed for several months.                    22090  1   18 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation techniques. The measurements were   22090  1   19 
            performed after about one year of cooling time.       22090  1   20 
DETECTOR   (GELI) A 70 cm3 Ge(Li) detector was used for the       22090  1   21 
           activity measurements in Cyclotron Radio Center        22090  1   22 
            (Tohoki Univ.). The samples were placed at a distance 22090  1   23 
           of 20 mm from the detector. The measurement times were 22090  1   24 
           about 75 to 120 hours. The iron dosimetry foils were   22090  1   25 
           measured in the same detector system.                  22090  1   26 
           (HPGE) The zirconium-niobium foils were measured at    22090  1   27 
           RTNS-II using a 80 cm3 high purity germanium detector  22090  1   28 
           in 2 or 3 days after taking out the foils.             22090  1   29

SAMPLE     .Aluminium disc samples of 2 cm diameter and 0.5 cm    22090  1   33 
            thickness were machined from high purity metal ingot. 22090  1   34 
            21 Samples were divided into 7 groups by three discs  22090  1   35 
            and fixed at a distance of 12 cm from the source,     22090  1   36 
            covering angles from 25 to 85 degrees with respect to 22090  1   37 
            the incident deuteron beam. 21 iron dosimetry foils   22090  1   38 
            were put on the surface of each sample disc to        22090  1   39 
            evaluate the neutron fluence. In addition, 7 sets of  22090  1   40 
            zirconium-niobium foils were attached in front of each22090  1   41 
            sample set to measure the average energies of the in- 22090  1   42
