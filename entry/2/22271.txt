FACILITY   (VDGT,2JPNTIT) The 3.2 MV PELLETRON accelerator of the 2227100100012 
            research laboratory for nuclear reactors at the Tokyo 2227100100013 
            Institute of Technology.                              2227100100014 
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a natural 2227100100015 
            Li sample, evaporated onto a copper disk, with a      2227100100016 
            pulsed 1.898 MeV proton beam. The beam pulse width was2227100100017 
            1.5 ns and the proton beam current 6 - 9 microAmps.   2227100100018 
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectrum had a most probable energy of 30 2227100100019 
            keV. Thermal neutrons were discriminated by time-of-  2227100100020 
            flight.                                               2227100100021 
SAMPLE     .The samples were made from natural carbon and natural 2227100100022 
            lithium, shaped as disks with a diameter of 5.4 cm by 2227100100023 
            1.5 cm thick and 6.0 cm diameter by 2.6 cm thick, res-2227100100024 
            pectively. The lithium sample was wrapped in a Vinyl  2227100100025 
            film. A gold sample was used for cross section        2227100100026 
            normalization. The samples were placed on the beam    2227100100027 
            axis at a distance of 8.1 cm from the neutron target, 2227100100028 
            which was sufficient to discriminate gamma-rays from  2227100100029 
            the latter with time-of-flight techniques. The mea-   2227100100030 
            surements were done cyclically, using the gold and    2227100100031 
            carbon or lithium samples, and a blank background.    2227100100032 
METHOD     (GSPEC) Prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy.                 2227100100033 
           (TOF)   Time-of-flight techniques used to discriminate 2227100100034 
            background.                                           2227100100035

DETECTOR   (NAICR) Prompt gamma-rays from neutron capture were    2227100100037 
            detected with an anti-compton NaI detector, located   2227100100038 
            80 cm from the sample at an angle of 125 degrees with 2227100100039 
            respect to the proton beam. It consisted of a 7.6 cm  2227100100040 
            diameter by 15.2 cm thick central NaI detector,       2227100100041 
            surrounded by an annular NaI detector with a diameter 2227100100042 
            of 25.4 cm and a thickness of 28.0 cm. The detector   2227100100043 
            was shielded with Li, Pb, Cd and borated paraffin.    2227100100044 
            The energy scale was calibrated using known gamma-rays2227100100045 
            from Na-22, K-40 and Fe-57. The response functions    2227100100046 
            were determined experimentally by calibrated gamma-   2227100100047 
            ray sources.                                          2227100100048 
           .The gamma-ray events were stored as two-dimensional   2227100100049 
            spectra of time-of-flight versus pulse-height.        2227100100050 
           (GLASD) The neutron spectrum was measured with a 6-Li  2227100100051 
            glass detector, operated in time-of-flight mode, and  2227100100052 
            located at an angle of 14 degrees with respect to the 2227100100053 
            proton beam. This detector was also used to normalize 2227100100054 
            the different runs to each other.                     2227100100055
