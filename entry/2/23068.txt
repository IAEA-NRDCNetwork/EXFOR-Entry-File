DECAY-DATA (32-GE-75,,DG,139.96)                                  2306800200004

           gamma-ray and 870.56 keV gamma-ray from O-17 were used 2306800200006 
           for an off-line adjustment of the gain using the most  2306800200007 
           recent version of AGL code.                            2306800200008 
ANALYSIS   (AREA) The data, measured with the planar detector     2306800200009 
           positioned at 125 degrees with respect to the neutron  2306800200010 
           beam, were analyzed, monitored weekly by measuring a   2306800200011 
           Eu-152 calibration source.                             2306800200012 
           Effective gamma-ray detection efficiency was deduced   2306800200013 
           with Monte Carlo simulation, using the MCNP code. MCNP 2306800200014 
           model was validated with measurements using a          2306800200015 
           well-characterized Eu-152 source. The model efficiency 2306800200016 
           reproduced the measured efficiency within 5%.          2306800200017 
           To deduce the full energy net peak areas, gamma-ray    2306800200018 
           spectra were analyzed with spectrum analysis program   2306800200019 
           Hypermet-PC [10].                                      2306800200020 
           Net peak areas for the observed gamma-rays ranging from2306800200021 
           0.1 MeV to 1.5 MeV were obtained.                      2306800200022 
           The branching ratio was obtained by calculating the    2306800200023 
           ratio between the sum of the resulting relative partial2306800200024 
           cross sections of the transition feeding the ground    2306800200025 
           state and the isomeric state.                          2306800200026 
CORRECTION Net peak areas were corrected for the effective        2306800200027 
           gamma-ray detection efficiency and for the internal    2306800200028 
           conversion effect.                                     2306800200029
