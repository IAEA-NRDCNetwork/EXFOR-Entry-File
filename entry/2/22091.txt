INC-SOURCE (D-T) Mono-energetic neutrons were produced by the     2209100100010 
            t(d,N) reaction, using a target with tritium absorbed 2209100100011 
            in titanium. Different neutron energies was obtained  2209100100012 
            by rotating the sample/detectors around the target    2209100100013 
            from 0 to 143 degrees.                                2209100100014

            scope was coupled in a back-to-back form for simul-   2209100100017 
            taneous measurement of the fission fragments and the  2209100100018 
            neutron fluence. Both detectors had a continous flow  2209100100019 
            of a gas mixture of 95 percent argon and 5 percent    2209100100020 
            carbon-dioxide. The arrangement was placed with the   2209100100021 
            sample/radiator at a distance of 15 cm from the       2209100100022 
            target.                                               2209100100023 
DETECTOR   (FISCH) The fission chamber was a parallel plate       2209100100024 
            ionization chamber with an inner diameter of 60 mm    2209100100025 
            and a distance of 17 mm between the electrode and the 2209100100026 
            sample.                                               2209100100027

            sisted of two gas proportional counters and a 1 mm    2209100100029 
            thick, 3 cm diameter CsI(Tl) scintillator. Coinci-    2209100100030 
            dences between all three units were required. The     2209100100031 
            radiator had a thickness of 28.04 milligram/cm2.      2209100100032 
            The sensitivity of the telescope were experimentally  2209100100033 
            determined in a separate experiment using the associ- 2209100100034 
            ated particle method.                                 2209100100035 
           (SCIN) A Ne 213 scintillation detector with neutron-   2209100100036 
            gamma discrimination was used to observe parasitic    2209100100037 
            neutrons. No such neutrons were found.                2209100100038

SAMPLE     .The U-235 sample, 25 mm in diameter and 94 microgram/ 2209100100040 
            cm2, was prepared by electro-deposition on a platinum 2209100100041
