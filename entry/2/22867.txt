DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Improved neutron  detector  consisted  of  16  2286700100013

            estimate the neutron energy. That varied between 2.5  2286700100020 
            and 4.4 leading to average neutron energies of about  2286700100021 
            1.2  MeV at highest photon energies and of about 0.3  2286700100022

COMMENT    The neutron capture cross  section  of  the  unstable  2286700100035 
            s-process  branching  nucleus  185W has been derived  2286700100036 
            from  experimental  data  of  inverse  186W(g,n)185W  2286700100037 
            photodisintegration  taken with monochromatic photon  2286700100038 
            beams from laser Compton scattering.  The result  of  2286700100039 
            SIG  =  553  (60)  mb  at  kT  =  30  keV leads to a  2286700100040 
            relatively high effective  neutron  density  in  the  2286700100041 
            classical  s-process  of Nn = 4.7 x 10**8 sm**-3.  A  2286700100042 
            realistic  model  for  the  s-process  in  thermally  2286700100043 
            pulsing  asymptotic giant branch stars overestimates  2286700100044 
            the abundance of 186Os significantly because of  the  2286700100045 
            relatively  small  neutron  capture cross section of  2286700100046 
            185W.                                                 2286700100047
