INC-SPECT  .THE AVERAGE NEUTRON ENERGY WAS DETERMINED BY THE REAC-2220300100015 
            TION RATIO OF ZR-90(N,2N) AND NB-93(N,2N), USING FOUR 2220300100016

SAMPLE     .THREE POLYETHYLENE PACKS OF THORIUM NITRATE POWDER OF 2220300100024 
            ABOUT 500 MG WEIGHT WERE USED. THE THORIUM SAMPLES    2220300100025 
            WERE SANDWICHED WITH 0.5 MM THICK ALUMINUM FOILS FOR  2220300100026
