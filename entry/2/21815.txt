            a Be-target of 0.25 inch thickness. The n-beam        21815  1   12 
            was confined to a diameter of 2 inches by             21815  1   13

INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum ranged from about 50 to 170 MeV, 21815  1   15 
            with a peak near 140 MeV. A graph of the spectrum     21815  1   16 
            is given in figure 8 of the main reference.           21815  1   17 
            The quantity 'En-mean' is a spectrum averaged         21815  1   18 
            energy between the limits 'En-min' and 'En-max'.      21815  1   19 
            it is called the 'effective energy' in the main       21815  1   20 
            reference. The quantity 'En-err' is the error in      21815  1   21 
            'En-mean' and arises from the error in the            21815  1   22 
            measured spectrum.                                    21815  1   23 
SAMPLE      Both samples (polyethylene and carbon) were           21815  1   24 
            5 inches long an 1.5 inches wide. They were           21815  1   25 
            100-200 microns thick.                                21815  1   26 
            The polyethylene sample was cut from a sheet          21815  1   27 
            of about 100 microns thickness. It consisted          21815  1   28 
            of 100% pure (C-H(2))(n). The thickness               21815  1   29 
            was 10.54 +-0.01 mg/cm**2.                            21815  1   30 
            The carbon sample was prepared by drying out          21815  1   31 
            of aquadag which had been diluted in water,           21815  1   32 
            in a metal mould. Removal of the dry C-film           21815  1   33 
            was facilitated by the use of a wet sheet of          21815  1   34 
            cellophane tightly stretched over the base of         21815  1   35 
            the mould. Its thickness was 13.62 +- 0.03 mg/cm**2   21815  1   36 
            and was chosen so as to produce the same energy       21815  1   37 
            loss as the polyethylene target film. It consisted    21815  1   38 
            of 93.4% carbon, 1% hydrogen and 5.6% oxygen.         21815  1   39 
METHOD     (REC) Measurement of the angular distributions of the  21815  1   40 
            recoiling particles from a carbon scatterer and from  21815  1   41 
            a polyethylene scatterer.                             21815  1   42 
            The difference yields the amounts of protons recoiling21815  1   43 
           from hydrogen nuclei as a function of the recoil angles21815  1   44 
            From these amounts the hydrogen elastic scattering    21815  1   45 
            angular distributions can be derived.                 21815  1   46 
            The proton angles are determined by the analysis      21815  1   47 
            of the proton tracks in a photographic emulsion.      21815  1   48 
            The proton energies are determined from               21815  1   49 
            the ranges of the protons in this emulsion.           21815  1   50 
            From this proton energy the neutron energy            21815  1   51 
            can be derived.                                       21815  1   52

            The four plates were held at angles of 54, 44, 34     21815  1   58 
            and 24 degrees to the neutron beam.                   21815  1   59 
            The plates at 44,34 and 24 degerees were behind       21815  1   60 
            aluminium absorbers designed to bring most of         21815  1   61 
            recoils to rest in the emulsion. Unfortunately        21815  1   62 
            the effect of multiple scattering in the              21815  1   63 
            aluminium was too large, and it was not possible      21815  1   64 
            to use the measurements on the plates at 34 and       21815  1   65
