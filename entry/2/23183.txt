           monitored with plastic scintillation detector NE102A,  2318300100054 
           placed under the neutron-producing target. The monitor 2318300100055

           measured by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer.    2318300100059 
           In all gamma-ray measurements an acrylic plate of 10mm 2318300100060 
           thickness was placed in front of the detector to block 2318300100061
