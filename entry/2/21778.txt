INC-SOURCE (POLNS,P-BE) Three beryllium targets were used         2177800100009 
              producing polarized neutron beams at +/- 26 degrees 2177800100010 
              to the incident protons and an unpolarized beam at  2177800100011 
              beam at zero degrees.                               2177800100012 
INC-SPECT  .Approximately triangular extending from 79 MeV to     2177800100013 
            121 MeV. The effective neutron energy of 98 +- 3 MeV  2177800100014 
            quoted in the common section was calculated from a    2177800100015 
            measurement of the attenuation of the beam by         2177800100016 
            polythene.                                            2177800100017

DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Counter telescope was mounted on a   2177800100022 
           movable arm which clamped to the table. Each plastic   2177800100023 
           scintillator was mounted in a perspex light guide in a 2177800100024 
           rigid metal frame and had inscribed at its centre a    2177800100025 
           small cross for alignment. The defining crystal al was 2177800100026 
           1.5 cm x 6.0 cm and 0.3 cm thick a placed at distance  2177800100027 
           from the scatterers.                                   2177800100028 
MONITOR    The monitor used was a trip triple coincidence proton  2177800100029 
           recoil telescope. It was similar to the counter        2177800100030 
           telescope so that the effect of small cyclotron energy 2177800100031 
           variations was largely cancelled out. Proton recoils   2177800100032 
           originated in a polythene radiator 1 cm thick placed   2177800100033 
           immediately after the collimator.                      2177800100034 
           A boron trifluoride slow neutron counter near the      2177800100035 
           apparatus was also used as a monitor throughout the    2177800100036 
           experiment as an additional check on the behaviour of  2177800100037 
            the equipment.                                        2177800100038
