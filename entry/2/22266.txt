            RESONANCE CAPTURE BY S-32.                            2226600100008 
FACILITY   (VDGT ) THE 3.2 MV PELLETRON ACCELERATOR AT THE TOKYO  2226600100009 
            INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. THE MACHINE IS PULSED WITH A 2226600100010 
            PULSE WIDTH OF 1.5 NS FWHM AND A REPETITION RATE OF   2226600100011 
            2 MHZ. THE AVERAGE BEAM CURRENT WAS 10 MICROAMPS.     2226600100012 
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) KEV NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A     2226600100013 
            LITHIUM-EVAPORATED COPPER DISK WITH PROTONS FROM THE  2226600100014 
            PELLETRON. THE COPPER DISK WAS COOLED BY SPRAYING     2226600100015 
            WATER FROM THE OUTSIDE.                               2226600100016 
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM WAS MEASURED BY TIME-OF-FLIGHT,  2226600100017 
            USING A LI-6 GLASS DETECTOR.                          2226600100018 
SAMPLE     .THE TARGET CONSISTED OF A NATURAL SULFUR DISK WITH A  2226600100019 
            WEIGHT OF 57 GRAMS AND HAVING A DIAMETER OF 58 MM AND 2226600100020 
            A THICKNESS OF 11 MM. THE THICKNESS ALLOWED A NEUTRON 2226600100021 
            TRANSMISSION OF ABOUT 70 PERCENT AT THE RESONANCE.    2226600100022 
           .THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF SOURCE NEUTRONS WERE DETERMINED2226600100023 
            USING A GOLD SAMPLE.                                  2226600100024

            SCINTILLATOR, LOCATED AT 3 M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE  2226600100029 
            AND IN THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION, WAS USED TO MEASURE 2226600100030 
            THE INCIDENT NEUTRON SPECTRUM. THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE  2226600100031 
            OF THE DETECTOR EFFICIENCY WAS CALCULATED USING A     2226600100032 
            MONTE CARLO METHOD.                                   2226600100033

            ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES TO THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION, WAS 2226600100035 
            USED TO MONITOR THE NUMBER OF NEUTRONS EMITTED FROM   2226600100036 
            THE SOURCE.                                           2226600100037 
           (NAICR) CAPTURE GAMMA-RAYS WERE DETECTED WITH A NAI-TL 2226600100038 
            DETECTOR, 76 MM IN DIAMETER BY 152 MM LONG, CENTERED  2226600100039

            ANTI-COMPTON DETECTOR, SURROUNDED BY A HEAVY SHIELD.  2226600100041 
            THE DETECTOR WAS PLACED AT 80 CM FROM THE SAMPLE AND  2226600100042 
            AT 125 DEGREES TO THE PROTON BEAM DIRECTION. A LI-6-  2226600100043 
            HYDRIDE SHIELD WAS INSERTED IN THE COLLIMATOR. THE    2226600100044 
            RESPONSE FUNCTION OF THE DETECTOR WAS DETERMINED WITH 2226600100045 
            THE AID OF CALIBRATED RADIOACTIVE SOURCES, AN AM-BE   2226600100046 
            NEUTRON SOURCE AND A FEW NUCLEAR REACTIONS. THE OVER- 2226600100047
