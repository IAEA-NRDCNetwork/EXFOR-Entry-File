METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time 2 min. irradiations were per- 2229500100019 
            formed with and without cadmium shielding. the delay  2229500100020 
            time from end of irradiation to start of activity     2229500100021 
            measurement was typically 1 min.                      2229500100022 
           .the monitor wires were irradiated for 10 min.         2229500100023 
DETECTOR   (HPGE ) The activities were measured with a HPGE detec-2229500100024 
            tor, having a relative efficiency of 90 percent and a 2229500100025 
            resolution of 2.1 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV. the distance  2229500100026 
            from the centre of the sample to the front end of the 2229500100027 
            detector was 100 mm. The peak efficiency was measured 2229500100028

            hydroxide as ammonium pertechnotate. the specific     2229500100038 
            activity was determined to 461 +/- 7 KBq per gram in  2229500100039 
            a liquid scintillation counter. the solution was put  2229500100040 
            into for 4 polyethylene tubes, 10 mm in outer diameter2229500100041 
            and 45 mm in outer length, with 1 mm thick walls. the 2229500100042 
            weight of each target was determined to within 0.1    2229500100043 
            percent, and the activity ranged from 371 to 375 KBq. 2229500100044
