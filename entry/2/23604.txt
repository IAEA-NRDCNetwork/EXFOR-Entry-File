INC-SOURCE (REAC)The graphite thermal column (TC-Pn) in KUR. The  2360400100019 
           nominal neutron flux intensity of TC-Pn is 5.86E+10    2360400100020 
            (n/cm2/sec) at 1 MW power operation. The AUTHORs      2360400100021 
           have confirmed that the TC-Pn was extremely            2360400100022 
           thermalized on the basis of Westcott's convention in   2360400100023 
           another experiment. (See Fig. 8 in the REL-REF.)       2360400100024 
SAMPLE     Np-237 standardized solution (Np(NO3)4 in 4 M HNO3)    2360400100025 
           was used for samples. Impurities of the solution were  2360400100026 
           measured with an alpha-ray spectroscopy and a mass     2360400100027 
           spectrometer.                                          2360400100028 
                      -Np-237 : Am-241 = 1 : 0.0014.              2360400100029 
                      -Am-243, Cm-244 and the other Np isotopes   2360400100030 
                       were not observed.                         2360400100031 
           Two standardized solutions equivalent to about 950 and 2360400100032 
           370 Bq were dropped onto pieces of glass filters.      2360400100033 
           The filters were dried by an infrared ramp.            2360400100034 
           The activity of the sample were determined using the   2360400100035 
           312-keV gamma-ray emitted from Pa-233.                 2360400100036 
           The deduced activities were:                           2360400100037 
                      Sample1: 961 +- 22 Bq and                   2360400100038 
                      Sample2: 379 +- 9 Bq.                       2360400100039 
           The samples and the monitors were irradiated in        2360400100040 
           the TC-Pn for 30 minutes under 1-MW power operation.   2360400100041 
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Based on Westcott's convention method.   2360400100042 
           Because the neutron flux in the TC-Pn is well          2360400100043 
           thermalized, epithermal component in Westcott's        2360400100044 
           convention method was negligibly small.                2360400100045 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) High purity germanium detector, relative        2360400100046 
           efficiency of 25%. The gamma-ray peak efficiencies of  2360400100047 
           the Ge detector were measured using a mixed source     2360400100048 
           AM-8140 (Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, Germany) :    2360400100049 
           Am-241, Cd-109, Co-57, Ce-139, Hg-203, Sn-113, Cs-137, 2360400100050 
           Co-60 and Y-88 whose uncertainty of source-activity    2360400100051 
           was 1.5%.                                              2360400100052 
ANALYSIS   The reaction rates of the Np-237 samples were          2360400100053 
           obtained from the yield of the 984.45-keV gamma rays   2360400100054 
           emitted from the irradiated samples.                   2360400100055 
           The thermal-neutron fluxes were derived using the      2360400100056 
           reaction rates and the thermal cross sections of the   2360400100057 
           monitors (Sc-45, Co-59, Mo-98, Ta-181 and Au-197).     2360400100058 
           Thermal capture cross sections and g-factors of        2360400100059 
           the monitors were taken from the REL-REF.              2360400100060 
           The cross section of Np-237 was derived from           2360400100061 
           the reaction rates and the activities of the samples,  2360400100062 
           and the deduced thermal-neutron flux.                  2360400100063 
CORRECTION Self-shielding coefficients for the monitors were      2360400100064 
           calculated from neutron capture cross-sections and     2360400100065 
           area densities of the monitors.                        2360400100066 
           Those for the Np-237 samples were estimated to be      2360400100067 
           unity from its number of nuclei.                       2360400100068

SAMPLE     A standardized solution equivalent to about 370 Bq     2360400300004 
           was dropped onto pieces of glass filters. The filters  2360400300005
