FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAORL) The Oak Ridge electron linac (ORELA)   2223700100009 
            was used as a pulsed neutron source in a high         2223700100010 
            resolution transmission experiment by Harvey et al.   2223700100011 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons in the energy range 0.5eV to 500 eV   2223700100012 
            were produced by spallation reaction using ORELA.     2223700100013 
            The accelerator pulse width was 16ns.                 2223700100014 
INC-SPECT   The neutron spectrum was measured by TOF techniques.  2223700100015 
METHOD     (TOF) The flight path length 80.394m and the TOF       2223700100016 
            channel width 8 to 64ns.                              2223700100017 
           (TRN) High resolution transmission measurements were   2223700100018 
            carried out by Harvey et Al. Analysis and corrections 2223700100019

            corrected total cross sections for Pu239 were carried 2223700100021 
            out by Derrien using data obtained with various sample2223700100022 
            thicknesses. MONTE CARLO method was used to obtain    2223700100023 
            resonance parameters and thus simulate the true and   2223700100024 
            effective X-sections. Calculations, including Doppler 2223700100025 
            and resolution broadening were done using the code    2223700100026 
            SAMMY.                                                2223700100027

            0.07471 at/B were used. The sample effective          2223700100029 
            temperature was 106(5)K.                              2223700100030
