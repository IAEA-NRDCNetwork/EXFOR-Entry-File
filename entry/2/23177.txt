           Effective average neutron flux at the sample position  23177  1   32

           0.0508 mm thickness, about 0.085 g weight were placed  23177  1   44 
           on a thin aluminum frame fixed on the target holder    23177  1   45 
           inclined at the angle of 45deg.                        23177  1   46

           monitored with plastic scintillation detector NE102A,  23177  1   56

           (HPGE) Gamma activities induced in the Al and Th foils 23177  1   58 
           were measured by high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer23177  1   59 
           with HpGe detector ORTEC GMX10180, 0.60 keV FWHM at    23177  1   60 
           5.9 keV, 1.80 keV FWHM at 1333 keV.                    23177  1   61

ANALYSIS          Full energy peak (FEP) areas were collected     23177  1   73 
           until a required uncertainty (1% to 2%) for the        23177  1   74

           The gamma peaks areas were evaluated by using the      23177  1   76 
           SAMPO90 program.                                       23177  1   77
