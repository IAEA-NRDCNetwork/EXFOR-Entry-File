INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a thick   2271900100009 
           7Li target with a proton beam whose energy Ep=1.912 MeV2271900100010 
           is above the reaction threshold of the 7Li(p,n)7Be.    2271900100011 
           The thick 7Li target as prepared by evaporating        2271900100012 
           metallic Li on a Pt plate in a Cu target assembly      2271900100013 
           which has 10 mm diam. The target was cooled by an      2271900100014 
           air-jet during the experiment.                         2271900100015 
SAMPLE     The 14N sample was a thin melamine film (C3H6N6)       2271900100016 
           prepared by vacuum evaporation on a 0.01 mm thick      2271900100017 
           Al foil. From weight of the sample, its thickness was  2271900100018 
           determined to 212+-1.2mu-g/cm2.                        2271900100019 
MONITOR    (3-LI-6(N,T)2-HE-4,,SIG) To measure the neutron        2271900100020 
           flux on the melamine sample, it was replaced with a    2271900100021 
           6LiF film which was evaporated on an Al foil           2271900100022 
            (0.01 mm) and 289+-1.2mu-g/cm2 thick.                 2271900100023 
           An unevaporated Al foil was used for background        2271900100024 
           measurement.                                           2271900100025 
DETECTOR   (IOCH) The gridded ionization chamber was filled with  2271900100026 
           Ar+2.5%CO2 as a counter gas. The gas pressure was      2271900100027 
           7.8x10**4Pa (0.8kgf/cm2).                              2271900100028
