           The U samples ( 19mm diameter, masses 7 to 20 microg)  23256  1   35 
           were prepared from solutions that were dried dropwise  23256  1   36 
             (stippled) onto Ti backing foils.                    23256  1   37 
           The U mass of each sample was determined by alpha      23256  1   38 
           counting using an alpha spectrometer (Eurisys Mesures- 23256  1   39 
           EM 7184). It's detection efficiency was determined by  23256  1   40 
           a calibrated alpha source (containing 239Pu, 241Am,    23256  1   41 
           244Cm, diameter 15mm, total activity 459 alpha/s) with 23256  1   42 
           uncertainty of 3% at the 2sigma confidence level.      23256  1   43 
           Indium foils were co-irradiated with the U or blank    23256  1   44 
           samples for flux monitoring.                           23256  1   45

           electrostatic deflecting system and a channeltron      23256  1   47 
           electron multiplier (Photonics X9551BL).               23256  1   48 
           (HPGE) Irradiated samples were gamma-counted using     23256  1   49 
           three separate HPGe detectors which were energy and    23256  1   50 
           efficiency calibrated using sources of 152Eu and 133Ba 23256  1   51 
           whose activity were known to a precision of 2% at the  23256  1   52 
           1sigma confidence level.                               23256  1   53 
             To characterize the 235mU detection efficiency,      23256  1   54 
           samples of different masses were prepared and traced   23256  1   55 
           with a known amount of isomer obtained by alpha-recoil 23256  1   56 
           collection from an electrodeposited 239Pu mother       23256  1   57 
           source. An alpha-recoil collection efficiency of       23256  1   58 
           0.31 +- 0.03 was determined,which agrees with          23256  1   59 
           calculated value 0.31 .                                23256  1   60 
           For the calibration of the U-235m conversion electron  23256  1   61

           collecting a known amount of U-235m recoils from the   23256  1   63 
           239Pu-241Pu mother source, adding varying amounts of   23256  1   64

METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) After irradiation, the U was dissolved   23256  1   71 
           off of the backing foil and radiochemically processed  23256  1   72 
           to remove fission products. The samples were then      23256  1   73 
           electroplated onto a stainless steel disk or a fresh Ti23256  1   74 
           backing foil and then counted. Cooling time was        23256  1   75 
           typically 90min.                                       23256  1   76 
ANALYSIS   Fit of the time spectrum showing U-235m isomer decay   23256  1   77 
           was performed by exponential decay plus a constant     23256  1   78 
           background, and the HL of 25.33min was obtained.       23256  1   79
