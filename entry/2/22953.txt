            Sample was placed 2cm downward from Li-7 neutron      22953  1   38 
            production target. Os,Au,C samples were wrapped by    22953  1   39 
            aramid sheet of 4 microm thickness.                   22953  1   40

            TOF spectrums were measured 1)without sample,         22953  1   43 
            2) with and without adding 0.4mm thick copper disk on 22953  1   44 
            existing copper backing (0.4mm),                      22953  1   45 
            3) for water and air cooling for copper backing.      22953  1   46 
           (SITA) Measurement was carried out cyclically by       22953  1   47 
             changing four samples of Os-186, Au, C and blank     22953  1   48

ANALYSIS   (REDUC) Constant background subtracted from TOF        22953  1   50 
             spectrum for Os,C and blank samples were obtained.   22953  1   51 
             TOF spectrum for blank sample was subtracted from    22953  1   52 
             that for Os and C to obtain net TOF spectrum, which  22953  1   53 
             was used to define neutron energy spectrum for       22953  1   54 
             osmium and carbon.                                   22953  1   55
