            TOF spectrums were measured 1)without sample,         22953  1   43 
            2) with and without adding 0.4mm thick copper disk on 22953  1   44

ANALYSIS   (REDUC) Constant background subtracted from TOF        22953  1   50 
             spectrum for Os,C and blank samples were obtained.   22953  1   51 
             TOF spectrum for blank sample was subtracted from    22953  1   52 
             that for Os and C to obtain net TOF spectrum, which  22953  1   53 
             was used to define neutron energy spectrum for       22953  1   54 
             osmium and carbon.                                   22953  1   55
