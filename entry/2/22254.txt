FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK)   The Karlsruhe pulsed 3.75 MV           2225400100010 
            Van de Graaff accelerator was used.                   2225400100011 
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons were produced near the threshold.     2225400100012 
INC-SPECT  .The neutron spectrum was similar to a Maxwellian      2225400100013 
            spectrum with a temperature of 25 keV.                2225400100014 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Simultaneous activation of target material2225400100015 
            and standard Au foils. A fast cyclic activation system2225400100016 
            with a fast sample changer was used. Both the         2225400100017 
            irradiation and counting phases were chosen to be 10  2225400100018 
            sec. The Au activity was measured after the cyclic    2225400100019 
            activation.                                           2225400100020 
DETECTOR   (HPGE)  The activity of C-15 was measured with a HPGE  2225400100021 
            detector with a relative efficiency of 35 percent and 2225400100022 
            an energy resolution of 1.72 KeV at 1.33 MeV. The     2225400100023 
            efficiency of the detector was measured with calibra- 2225400100024 
            ted sources up to 1.84 MeV, and the range up to 11 MeV2225400100025 
            was covered with the gamma-ray lines of the 992 keV   2225400100026 
            resonance of the radiative proton capture reaction on 2225400100027 
            Al-27. Also a Pu-238+C-13 source with a line at 6.13  2225400100028 
            MeV was used. To obtain a fast cyclic time, the detec-2225400100029 
            tor was placed close to the neutron generation. It was2225400100030 
            therefore well shielded. During the activity counting 2225400100031 
            phase the neutron generation was stopped by a proton  2225400100032 
            beam stop in the beam line. To reduce pile-up from the2225400100033 
            activated nickel container, a lead shielding of 28 mm 2225400100034 
            was placed between the sample and the detector. In    2225400100035 
            this way the background count rate between 200 keV and2225400100036 
            6.1 MeV was reduced to 10 kHz for a sample-detector   2225400100037 
            distance of 50 mm. This could be further reduced to   2225400100038 
            35 mm by replacing the Pb shield by 15 mm tungsten.   2225400100039 
           (GLASD) The neutron flux was monitored by a Li-6 glass 2225400100040 
            scintillation counter.                                2225400100041

SAMPLE     .The sample consisted of C-14 powder with an enrichment2225400100046 
            of 89 percent, packed in a 0.0508 mm thick electro-   2225400100047 
            formed nickel container with a porous C-H2 plug glued 2225400100048 
            into the open end. The container had a volume of      2225400100049 
            2.97 cm * 1.20 cm * 0.5 cm. The effective area to be  2225400100050 
            irradiated was 2.97 cm * 1.20 cm = 3.56 cm2. Because  2225400100051 
            of a previous experiment with 500 MeV protons, the    2225400100052 
            nickel container was highly activated. The sample was 2225400100053 
            sandwiched between two gold foils of the same area,   2225400100054 
            having weights of 70 - 77 mg. Five individual runs of 2225400100055 
            the C-14 sample, each being about 5 days, were per-   2225400100056 
            formed.                                               2225400100057 
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for background and dead-time, 2225400100058 
            and for gain shifts during the measurements.          2225400100059
