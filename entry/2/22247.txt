FACILITY   (CYCLO,2GERJUL) The Variable Energy Compact CV28       2224700100012 
                     Cyclotron at the Institut FOR Chemistry,     2224700100013 
                           Yulich, was Used.                      2224700100014 
INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) Quasi-Monoenergetic Neutrons of Energy Between 2224700100015 
            8.7 MeV and 10.7 MeV were Produced by Bombarding a    2224700100016 
            Deuterium Gas Target with Deuterons of Energy Between 2224700100017 
            6 and 8 MeV.                                          2224700100018 
INC-SPECT  .The Average Neutron Energy Effective at the Sample was2224700100019 
            Calculated Using a Monte Carlo Programme.             2224700100020 
            The Neutron Flux Densities in Front and at the Back of2224700100021 
            The Sample were Determined Via the Al-27(N,A) Monitor 2224700100022 
            Reaction Whoo Secross Section was Taken from the      2224700100023 
            Literature. The Average Neutron Flux Density Effectve 2224700100024 
            At the Sample was Then Obtained Taking Into Account   2224700100025 
            The Flux Distribution Inside the Sample. The Relative 2224700100026 
            Flux Distribution Inside the Sample was Calculated    2224700100027 
            Both by Monte Carlo and Numerical Integration         2224700100028 
            Techniques. The Calculated Flux Distribution was      2224700100029 
            Finally Normamalised to the Value from the Front of   2224700100030 
            The Al Monitor Foil and the Resulting Absolute        2224700100031 
            Distribution was Averaged. Each Flux Density was      2224700100032 
            Weighted with Respect to Its Irradiation Time.        2224700100033 
SAMPLE     .Samples were Made of High Purity Tb4o7 (99.999        2224700100034 
            PERCENT (PC) AND 10 G) Or Eu2o3 (99.99PC,4.5G)        2224700100035 
            Contained in a Polythene Tube of 1.6 Cm Diameter,     2224700100036 
            4.3 Cm Length and 0.1 Cm in Thickness.                2224700100037 
            Al Monitor Foils of 200 Micro-M Thicness were Attached2224700100038 
            At the Front and at the Back of the Tube. Each Sample 2224700100039 
            Was Irradiated Several Times, Each Time with a Fresh  2224700100040 
            Al Monitor. Each Eu and Tb Sample was Irradiated at   2224700100041 
            Zero Degree Direction For Between 7 to 10 Hrs and 10  2224700100042 
            To 20 Hrs, Respectively. Measurements were Carried Out2224700100043 
            Several Months After Irradiations and Took About 3    2224700100044 
            Days For Each Sample.                                 2224700100045 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The Neutron Activation Technique was Used.     2224700100046 
DETECTOR   (GELI ) The Gamma Activity of the Irradiated Samples   2224700100047 
            Was Measured Using a Ge(LI) Detector. The Peak Area   2224700100048 
            Analysis was done Using the Programme Maestro. Due to 2224700100049 
            The Large Dimensions of the Sample, the Inhomogeneous 2224700100050 
            Distribution of the Activity and the Low Count Rates, 2224700100051 
            The Detection Efficiency was Determined Following a   2224700100052 
            Procedure Which Makes Use of Counting in Various      2224700100053 
            Geometry Arrangements Gamma-Rays from a Standard      2224700100054 
            Source and from the Samples. Self-Absorption          2224700100055 
            Was Measured by Placing an Unirradiated Absorbent     2224700100056 
            Of Material and Geometry Similar to the Those of the  2224700100057 
            Samples Between the Source and the Detector.          2224700100058

            Sections were Taken from Irdf,1990.                   2224700100060 
CORRECTION .The Activity of the Monitor Product was Corrected     2224700100061 
            For Background Contributions. The Correction Due to   2224700100062 
            Breakup of Deutrons on D2 Gas was Negligible.         2224700100063 
            Corrections For Background Neutrons and For Coinciden-2224700100064 
            Ce were Applied.The Latter was Estimated from the     2224700100065 
            Decay Scheme and the Effective Detector Efficiency.   2224700100066 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Error on the Experimental Values was Derived   2224700100067 
            Taking Into Account -                                 2224700100068 
           (ERR-1) The Error on the Neutron Flux Density About 8% 2224700100069 
           (ERR-2) Error of the Absolute Activity of the Products 2224700100070 
                   Counted About 10%. Individual Errors           2224700100071 
            Are Combined in Quadrature to Yield a Total Error For 2224700100072
