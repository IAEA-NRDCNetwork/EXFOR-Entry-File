INC-SOURCE (D-D) Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons of energy between   22247  1   16 
            8.7 MeV and 10.7 MeV were produced by bombarding a    22247  1   17 
            deuterium gas target with deuterons of Energy between 22247  1   18 
            6 and 8 MeV.                                          22247  1   19 
INC-SPECT   The average neutron energy effective at the sample was22247  1   20 
            calculated using a Monte Carlo program.               22247  1   21 
            The neutron flux densities in front and at the back of22247  1   22 
            the sample were determined via the Al-27(n,alpha)     22247  1   23 
            monitor reaction whose cross section was taken from   22247  1   24 
            the literature. The average neutron flux density      22247  1   25 
            effective at the sample was then obtained taking into 22247  1   26 
            account the flux distribution inside the sample. The  22247  1   27 
            relative flux distribution inside the sample was      22247  1   28 
            calculated both by Monte Carlo and numerical integrat.22247  1   29 
            techniques. The calculated flux distribution was      22247  1   30 
            finally normalised to the value from the front of     22247  1   31 
            the Al monitor foil and the resulting absolute        22247  1   32 
            distribution was averaged. Each flux density was      22247  1   33 
            weighted with respect to its irradiation time.        22247  1   34 
SAMPLE     Al monitor foils of 200 micro-m thickness were attached22247  1   35 
            at the front and at the back of the tube. Each sample 22247  1   36 
            was irradiated several times, each time with a fresh  22247  1   37 
            Al monitor. Each sample was irradiated at             22247  1   38 
            zero degree direction for between 7 to 10 hrs and 10  22247  1   39 
            to 20 hrs, respectively. Measurements were carried out22247  1   40 
            several months after irradiations and took about 3    22247  1   41 
            days for each sample.                                 22247  1   42 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron activation technique was used.     22247  1   43 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) 140 cm3 3 HPGe detector.                        22247  1   44 
           (GELI) The gamma activity of the irradiated samples    22247  1   45 
            was measured using a Ge(Li) detector.                 22247  1   46 
           Also, it used for measurement the radioactivity of the 22247  1   47 
           monitor reaction product (24Na). The peak area         22247  1   48 
            analysis was done using the program Maestro. Due to   22247  1   49 
            the large dimensions of the sample, the inhomogeneous 22247  1   50 
            distribution of the activity and the low count rates, 22247  1   51 
            the detection efficiency was determined following a   22247  1   52 
            procedure which makes use of counting in various      22247  1   53 
            geometry arrangements gamma-rays from a standard      22247  1   54 
            source and from the samples. Self-absorption          22247  1   55 
            was measured by placing an unirradiated absorbent     22247  1   56 
            of material and geometry similar to the those of the  22247  1   57 
            samples between the source and the detector.          22247  1   58

CORRECTION  The activity of the monitor product was corrected     22247  1   62 
            for background contributions. The correction due to   22247  1   63 
            breakup of deuterons on D2 gas was negligible.        22247  1   64 
            Corrections for background neutrons and for coinciden-22247  1   65 
            ce were applied. The latter was estimated from the    22247  1   66 
            decay scheme and the effective detector efficiency.   22247  1   67
