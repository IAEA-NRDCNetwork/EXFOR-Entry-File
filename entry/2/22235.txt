INC-SOURCE (D-T) The neutrons were produced by bombarding a       2223500100010 
            copper based Ti-T target with a 212 keV beam of 20    2223500100011

INC-SPECT  .The average neutron energy was determined by the reac-2223500100013 
            tion ratio of Zr-90(n,2n) and Nb-93(n,2n), using 2    2223500100014 
            Zr and 2 Nb foils at a distance of 1.5 cm from the    2223500100015 
            Ti-T target. The reaction ratio for this position was 2223500100016 
            1.57 from which the corresponding average neutron     2223500100017 
            energy of 14.5+/-0.2 MeV was obtained. The flux       2223500100018 
            distribution and energy spectrum of the neutrons above2223500100019 
            6.5 MeV in the thorium samples were calculated with   2223500100020 
            the Monte Carlo code MCNP in which the source neutron 2223500100021 
            spectrum, which had been measured with a silicium     2223500100022

METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)                                          2223500100024 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activities were measured with calibrated    2223500100025 
            small and large pure germanium detectors. Their re-   2223500100026 
            lative efficiencies for a 3x3 inc NaI scin are 10 and 2223500100027 
            30% respectively. The absolute Th-231 activity        2223500100028 
            was determined by comparison with the activity from   2223500100029 
            a 90% enriched uranium-aluminum alloy which           2223500100030 
            contains Th-231.                                      2223500100031 
            The time dependence of the neutron flux was monitored 2223500100032 
            using a moderator type neutron dose rate meter located2223500100033 
            about 2 m from the Ti-T target.                       2223500100034

SAMPLE     .Three polyethylene packs of thorium nitrate powder of 2223500100039 
           about 500 mg weight were used. The thorium samples     2223500100040 
           were sandwiched with 0.5 mm thick aluminum foils for   2223500100041 
           neutron fluence monitoring. The distance between the   2223500100042 
           Ti-T target and the front surface of the samples was   2223500100043 
           1.6 cm. The samples were irradiated for about 7.5 hrs. 2223500100044 
           After irradiation the samples were chemically purified 2223500100045
