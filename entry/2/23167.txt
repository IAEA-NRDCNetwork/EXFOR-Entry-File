INC-SPECT  Nearly symmetrical Gaussian-shaped beam profile at the 2316700100064 
           sample position of 185.2 m, with a standard deviation  2316700100065 
           of about 0.77 cm at low neutron energies.              2316700100066 
           In addition to Monte Carlo simulations, measurement    2316700100067 
           of the flux performed with 235U-loaded parallel-plate  2316700100068

           During the capture measurements the relative neutron   2316700100071 
           flux was measured with an in-beam neutron monitor SiMon2316700100072 
           ,consisting of a 6Li deposit on a Mylar foil and four  2316700100073 
           off-beam silicon detectors for the detection of the    2316700100074 
           6Li(n,t)alpha reaction products. Up to 1 keV both      2316700100075 
           methods are in good agreement.                         2316700100076 
           The neutron flux adopted for the capture yield is an   2316700100077 
           analytical fit of the measured flux from the SiMon     2316700100078 
           detectors up to 1 keV and pointwise data from the PTB  2316700100079

           For energy calibration of each C6D6 detector authors   2316700100085 
           measured the response to radioactive sources of 137Cs  2316700100086 
            (0.662 MeV), 60Co (1.173 and 1.332 MeV), and composite2316700100087 
           source of 238Pu with 13C (6.13-MeV gamma-ray through   2316700100088 
           13C(a,n)16O* reaction).Energy deposition in the C6D6   2316700100089 
           liquid scintillator volume for each of these sources   2316700100090 
           was simulated by MCNP code.                            2316700100091 
           The data-acquisition system was based on Acqiris flash 2316700100092 
           ADCs with 8-bit amplitude resolution and down to 1 ns  2316700100093 
           sampling interval with 8 Mbytes of memory, recording   2316700100094 
           for each detector its full output signal from the start2316700100095 
           time given by the incident protons.The digitizers were 2316700100096 
           operated at 500 Msamples/s, allowing storage of the    2316700100097 
           detector signal during a 16-ms-long time-of-flight     2316700100098 
           interval, corresponding to a minimum neutron energy of 2316700100099 
           0.7 eV.                                                2316700100100 
SAMPLE      Two disk-shaped thorium samples of 99.5% purity with  2316700100101 
           total mass of 2.8046 g and diameter of 15 mm were      2316700100102 
           placed in the beam at a flight path of 185.2 m.        2316700100103 
           Natural lead sample to estimate the scattered photon   2316700100104 
           background and a gold sample to verify the analysis    2316700100105 
           procedure.                                             2316700100106 
           Thorium sample with a thickness of 4.1E-3 atoms/b.     2316700100107 
           All samples were fixed on thin kapton foils and        2316700100108 
           mounted on the sample changer. The distance of the     2316700100109 
           detectors from the center of the beam was 2.9 cm and   2316700100110 
           the detectors were shifted 9.2 cm upstream from the    2316700100111 
           center of the sample in order to reduce the scattered  2316700100112 
           photon background.                                     2316700100113 
METHOD     (TOF)  Flight path 182.5 m.                            2316700100114 
            Pulse-height weighted spectra used to derive the      2316700100115 
           capture yield.                                         2316700100116 
           Runs without beam served to determine the background   2316700100117 
           due to the thorium activity.                           2316700100118 
           The flight time was calibrated for each pulse using the2316700100119 
           so-called gamma flash. The flight path length was      2316700100120 
           calibrated using a measurement of the first resonance  2316700100121 
           of gold. Measurement with gold was used to fit the     2316700100122 
           flight path 185.2 m in combination with the resolution 2316700100123 
           function, using energy of the first resonance 4.89 eV. 2316700100124 
           Doppler broadening, resolution broadening, width of    2316700100125 
           proton pulse, resonance spacing were considered as     2316700100126 
           contributions in observed resonance widths.            2316700100127 
ANALYSIS   Two saturated resonances at 21.8 and 23.5 eV were used 2316700100128 
           to determine the normalization.                        2316700100129

ANALYSIS   Experimental capture yields were compared with         2316700200005 
           calculated ones by ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluation. Only the   2316700200006

           resonances presently available in ENDF/B-VII.0 were    2316700200008 
           used.The data set given in Table II of PR/C,85,064601  2316700200009 
           reflects only the ENDF/B-VII.0 evaluated parameters    2316700200010 
           without readjustment from resonances experimentally    2316700200011 
           observed in the present measurement.                   2316700200012
