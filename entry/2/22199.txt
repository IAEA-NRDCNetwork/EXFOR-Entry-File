INC-SOURCE (D-D  ) A PULSED BEAM OF 10.3 MEV (FWHM 0.6 MEV) NEU-  2219900100012 
            TRONS WAS PRODUCED BY THE D-D REACTION, USING A DEU-  2219900100013 
            TERIUM GAS TARGET. THE AVERAGE INTENSITY WAS 5E+6 PER 2219900100014 
            SECOND.                                               2219900100015 
METHOD     (TOF  ) THE ENERGIES OF THE EMITTED NEUTRONS WERE DE-  2219900100016 
            TERMINED WITH TIME-OF-FLIGHT TECHNIQUES.              2219900100017 
           (PSD  ) NEUTRON-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS APPLIED.      2219900100018 
DETECTOR   (SCIN ) THE EMITTED NEUTRONS WERE DETECTED IN FOUR     2219900100019 
            NE213 LIQUID SCINTILLATORS, ARRANGED IN TWO IDENTICAL 2219900100020 
            ARMS AT 30 DEGREES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BEAM. EACH   2219900100021 
            ARM CONSISTED OF TWO DETECTORS, ONE ANNULAR DETECTOR, 2219900100022 
            40 MM THICK AND WITH INNER/OUTER DIAMETERS OF 120/140 2219900100023 
            MM, AND ONE STANDARD DETECTOR, 180 MM IN DIAMETER BY  2219900100024 
            80 MM THICK. THE DETECTORS IN EITHER ARM WERE PLACED  2219900100025 
            AT 1 AND 2 M FROM THE SAMPLE, RESPECTIVELY. THIS      2219900100026 
            ARRANGEMENT ALLOWED MEASUREMENT AT LOW N-N RELATIVE   2219900100027 
            ENERGIES. THE DETECTORS WERE HOUSED IN MASSIVE SHIEL- 2219900100028 
            DINGS CONSISTING OF BRASS, STEEL AND WATER. THE       2219900100029 
            EFFICIENCIES OF THE DETECTORS WERE MEASURED BY THE    2219900100030 
            ASSOCIATED PARTICLE METHOD AS WELL AS BY UTILIZING A  2219900100031 
            252-CF FISSION SOURCE. A NEUTRON FLUX MONITOR WAS     2219900100032 
            POSITIONED IN THE BEAM DIRECTION.                     2219900100033

            THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA WITH A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION,  2219900100041 
            IN WHICH THE WATSON-MIGDAL MODEL WAS USED. IN THE     2219900100042
