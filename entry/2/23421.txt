           to obtain the scattering function S(q,w) - dynamic     23421  1   63 
           structure factor.                                      23421  1   64 
           The LAMP software was used to read the IN4 and IN5     23421  1   65 
           data-sets for the vanadium reference, the empty and    23421  1   66 
           the water filled sample cell.                          23421  1   67 
SAMPLE     The micropore high-purity water samples were inserted  23421  1   68 
           in an aluminum flat container with thickness 0.05 and  23421  1   69 
           0.25mm for light and heavy water, respectively, with   23421  1   70 
           an indium wire sealing.                                23421  1   71 
           The light water sample scattering was measured at      23421  1   72 
           T = 285, 290, 294, 301, 311, 323 K.                    23421  1   73 
           The heavy water sample scattering was measured         23421  1   74 
           at T = 295 and 325 K.                                  23421  1   75 
ANALYSIS   The data were normalized to the counting time,         23421  1   76 
           calibrated on the V reference response, corrected for  23421  1   77 
           the detector energy-dependent efficiency, for the      23421  1   78 
           sample flat cell tilted geometry, finally converted    23421  1   79 
           from the radial angle and time space into the momentum 23421  1   80 
           and energy space representation to obtain the dynamic  23421  1   81 
           structure factor S(q,w).                               23421  1   82 
           In the temperature range the dynamic structure factor  23421  1   83 
           was found not to vary more than by a few per cent, so  23421  1   84 
           all acquisitions were merged to improve the statistical23421  1   85 
           accuracy.The effective temperature is T = 307 +- 14 K  23421  1   86 
           and T = 310 +- 17 K for light and heavy water,         23421  1   87 
           respectively.                                          23421  1   88 
           MD (molecular dynamics) simulations were performed     23421  1   89
