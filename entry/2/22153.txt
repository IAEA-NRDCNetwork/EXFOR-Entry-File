INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) BURSTS OF NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED FROM THE      2215300100013 
            WATER-COOLED PHOTONEUTRON TARGET, WHICH WERE MADE OF  2215300100014 
            SEVERAL SHEETS OF TA PLATES, 5 CM BY 5 CM SQUARE WITH 2215300100015 
            AN EFFECTIVE TOTAL THICKNESS OF ABOUT 3.5 CM. THE TAR-2215300100016 
            GET WAS PLACED IN THE CENTER OF AN OCTAGONAL WATER    2215300100017 
            TANK, 30 CM IN DIAMETER AND 10 CM THICK, TO MODERATE  2215300100018 
            THE NEUTRONS. A 7 CM DIAMETER BY 20 CM LONG PB BLOCK  2215300100019 
            WAS PLACED IN THE FLIGHT PATH IN FRONT OF THE TARGET  2215300100020 
            TO SUPPRESS THE PROMPT GAMMA-FLASH. THE NEUTRON BEAM  2215300100021 
            WAS AT AN ANGLE OF 135 DEG TO THE LINAC BEAM AND WAS  2215300100022 
            REDUCED TO 2 CM DIAMETER AT THE DETECTOR POSITION     2215300100023 
            USING B4C, LI2CO3 AND PB COLLIMATORS. A 0.5 MM THICK  2215300100024 
            CD FILTER WAS PLACED IN THE NEUTRON BEAM TO SUPPRESS  2215300100025
