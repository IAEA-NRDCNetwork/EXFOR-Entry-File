FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNJAE) ANNRI(BL04) beam line of MLF at J-PARC 2360800100011 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target        2360800100012 
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons (150 kW) . The proton    2360800100013 
           beams were supplied at a repetition rate of 25 Hz and  2360800100014 
           in the "double-bunch mode". Produced neutrons were     2360800100015 
           slowed down in a supercritical para hydrogen moderator.2360800100016 
INC-SPECT  Relative neutron flux was reconstructed using the 478  2360800100017 
           keV gamma-rays from gamma rays from the B-10           2360800100018 
           (n,alpha gamma) Li-7 reactions.                        2360800100019 
DETECTOR   (GE,BGO) An array of Ge detector consists of two       2360800100020 
           cluster-Ge detectors and eight coaxial-Ge detectors    2360800100021 
           with BGO anti-coincidence shields. DAQ: CAEN V1724     2360800100022 
           Digitizer (14bit, 100MHz)                              2360800100023 
SAMPLE     1-mm-thick La-nat metal plate.                         2360800100024 
METHOD     (TOF) Flight length: 21.5 m                            2360800100025 
CORRECTION Dead time correction was applied with a paralyzable    2360800100026 
           dead time model.                                       2360800100027 
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) The 0.758-eV p-wave resonance was fitted with  2360800100028 
           the Breit-Wigner function including the background     2360800100029 
           and the s- wave component (1/v term) . The effects of  2360800100030 
           the Doppler broadening (free gas at 295 K) and the     2360800100031 
           resolution function of ANNRI were convolved with the   2360800100032 
           Breit-Wigner function. In the fitting, the total       2360800100033 
           width of the 0.758-eV p-wave resonance was used as     2360800100034 
           the gamma width, because the neutron width of the      2360800100035 
           p-wave resonance is negligibly smaller than the gamma  2360800100036 
           width.                                                 2360800100037 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of resonance prameters      2360800100038 
           were deduced from the uncertainty of the fitting       2360800100039 
           result.                                                2360800100040
