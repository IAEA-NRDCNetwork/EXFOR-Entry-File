FACILITY   (CCW,3HUNKOS) The neutron generator of the Institute   2210300100009 
           of Experimental Physics at Debrecen, was used to       2210300100010 
           produce a 250 micro-Amps analysed beam of 220 +/- 5 keV2210300100011 
           deuterons.                                             2210300100012 
INC-SOURCE (D-D) An air-jet cooled Ti-D target thicker than the   2210300100013 
            range of the deuterons with a 0.33 mm thick Mo backing2210300100014 
            was employed in a low-mass beam line construction.    2210300100015 
METHOD     (ACTIV) A fission chamber with niobium and monitor     2210300100016 
            foils mounted inside and outside the chamber was      2210300100017 
            placed at 0 degrees relative to the deuterium beam.   2210300100018 
DETECTOR   (SOLST) A Si(Li) X-ray detector, 25 mm in diameter and 2210300100019 
            5 mm thick with a 0.0125 mm beryllium window, giving  2210300100020 
            a resolution of 400 eV at 17 keV, was used for the    2210300100021 
            measurement of the niobium K-shell X-radiation. The   2210300100022 
            absolute efficiency of the detector was determined by 2210300100023 
            means of a thin, point-like Nb-93m reference source.  2210300100024 
           (FISCH) A fission chamber, containing 168.2 +/- 2.5    2210300100025 
            micrograms of U-238, enriched to 99.98%, in           2210300100026 
            form of the compound UF4, was used. The chamber was   2210300100027 
            operated with a voltage gradient of 600 V/cm and a    2210300100028 
            continuous gas flow of pure argon counting gas. The   2210300100029 
            mass of U-238 was determined by comparing with the    2210300100030 
            activity in an aluminium foil after irradiation with  2210300100031 
            14.8 MeV neutrons, using the ratio of the well-known  2210300100032 
            cross sections for 13-Al-27(n,a)11-Na-24 and          2210300100033 
            92-U-238(n,f). The cross sections used were 112.10 mb 2210300100034 
            +/- 0.6% and 1184.4 mb +/- 1.2%, respectively.        2210300100035 
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) The neutron fluence determined    2210300100036 
            with the 10 mm diameter fissionable material was      2210300100037 
            interrelated to the 20 mm diameter niobium foils by   2210300100038 
            also irradiating nickel foils with these two dia-     2210300100039 
            meters.                                               2210300100040 
SAMPLE     .Niobium foils, 20 mm diameter and with a mass of      2210300100041 
            364.24 grams, positioned 1 cm from the neutron source,2210300100042 
            were used. The foils were irradiated for 210 hours,   2210300100043 
            resulting in a total neutron fluence of 9.0000e+12    2210300100044 
            n/cm2. Nickel foils were used for size normalisation. 2210300100045 
            A tantalum foil, 20 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm thick   2210300100046 
            was used for determining the background from tantalum 2210300100047 
            impurities in the niobium samples.                    2210300100048 
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for self-absorption in the   2210300100049 
            foils and for the effects of the extension of the     2210300100050 
            source. Further, the data were corrected for fluore-  2210300100051 
            scence caused by Ta impurities in the Nb samples, for 2210300100052 
            elastic neutron scattering and for background.        2210300100053 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are composed of contributions    2210300100054 
            from the measurement of the Nb-93 activity and from   2210300100055 
            fluence related measurements.                         2210300100056
