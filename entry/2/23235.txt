METHOD     (ACTIV) Ir standards were irradiated under Cd cover and2323500100020 
           the Cd ratios were subsequently used, along with the   2323500100021 
           known Q0-values, to determine FCd - resonance neutron  2323500100022 
           cadmium transmission factor.                           2323500100023 
           The two-channel method was used to determine Q0-values:2323500100024 
           irradiating a standard of the element, along with Au   2323500100025 
           monitor, in two reactor irradiation channels with very 2323500100026 
           different f, to determine the k0-value of one of the   2323500100027 
           gamma-rays emitted by the nuclide produced.            2323500100028 
           The Ir foil standards were irradiated in channels S84  2323500100029 
           and X26.                                               2323500100030 
           The specific activities of 192Ir, 194Ir and 198Au were 2323500100031 
           measured by counting the samples at a distance of 25cm 2323500100032 
           from the HPGe detector.                                2323500100033 
           The Q0 values obtained were verified using a similar   2323500100034 
           irradiation in channel Y4.                             2323500100035 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-rays were detected with three HPGe        2323500100036 
           detectors with relative efficiency of about 40 % .     2323500100037

           0.1 mm thickness were punched from these foils and     2323500100042 
           accurately weighed. Each disc contained approximately  2323500100043 
           33 microg Ir.                                          2323500100044

           foil, containing 0.1003 +- 0.0012 % Au, was punched    2323500100046 
           similarly. The Au monitors were used to redetermine f  2323500100047
