METHOD     (TOF) Standard time of flight technique. The scattering20060  1   13 
           sphere was placed 60 mm from the target and the        20060  1   14

           (BCINT) Two methods were used for monitoring of the    20060  1   16 
           incident neutron flux, viz. beam current integration   20060  1   17 
           and a LiI-polythene counter, the latter being placed   20060  1   18 
           well within the cone of neutron emission to avoid undue20060  1   19 
           dependence on fluctuations of the proton energy, and   20060  1   20
