INC-SOURCE (REAC) The samples were irradiated in the              21884  1   10 
            graphite reflector of the reactor.                    21884  1   11 
INC-SPECT   The thermal neutron flux was 1.6E+13 neutrons/cm-sq*Se21884  1   12 
            and 1.4E+13 neutrons/cm-sq*sec for the two samples,   21884  1   13 
            respectively.                                         21884  1   14 
SAMPLE      Two samples of about 555 Mg uranium enriched to about 21884  1   15 
            90% U-235. Each sample consisted of 9 chips           21884  1   16 
            of 55-65 Mg of uranium metal. Each chip was wrapped in21884  1   17 
            aluminum foil (20 um thick). The chips were place in  21884  1   18 
            larger aluminum cans, three by three, and three such  21884  1   19 
            cans formed one sample.                               21884  1   20 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation time was about 30 days.            21884  1   21

DETECTOR   (GELI) A coaxial Ge(Li) detector with a 16.9%          21884  1   23 
            photopeak efficiancy relative to a 3 inch * 3 inch    21884  1   24 
            NaI(Tl) crystal and a resolution of 2.1 keV for the   21884  1   25 
            1.33 MeV gamma-ray of Co-60 was used for detection of 21884  1   26 
            the 478. keV gamma-ray of Be-7 and radiation from     21884  1   27 
            Ba-140 used a monitor for the number of fissions.     21884  1   28 
            The Be-samples were also counted in a calibrated      21884  1   29 
            low-background gas flow window counter provided with  21884  1   30 
            an anticoincidence guard counter to measure possible  21884  1   31 
            beta activity of 1.6e+06 yr Be-10. the same beta-     21884  1   32 
            counter was used to measure the beta activity of Si-3221884  1   33 
            and its daughter p-32 with half-life 14.28 d.         21884  1   34 
ANALYSIS    The number of fissions in the irradiated U-235 sample 21884  1   35 
            was determined from the amount of Ba-140 produced in  21884  1   36 
            the sample. This number was determined to be          21884  1   37 
            1.5e+19 and 0.9e+19 for the two samples, respectively 21884  1   38 
            Since no or very small evidences for excistance       21884  1   39 
            of activity were observed, only upper limits for      21884  1   40 
            fission yields are given.                             21884  1   41
