           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during 2274401100043 
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.       2274401100044 
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector   2274401100045 
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba, 2274401100046

           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were         2274401100051 
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122  2274401100052

           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during 2274401200042 
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.       2274401200043 
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector   2274401200044

           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were         2274401200050 
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122  2274401200051

METHOD     (GSPEC) The prompt and beta-delayed gamma-rays were    2274401300039 
           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during 2274401300040 
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.       2274401300041 
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector   2274401300042 
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba, 2274401300043

           code (GEANT4) (Agostinelli et al., 2003).              2274401300047 
           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were         2274401300048 
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122  2274401300049 
           and 5 MeV, and 1.0% above 5 MeV.                       2274401300050

           approximately 14x61 mm2.                               2274401500028

           The neutron beam at the irradiation position was       2274401700024 
           approximately 14x61 mm2.                               2274401700025 
           The fluctuation of neutron flux was monitored by 198Au 2274401700026 
           activity by inserting the 197Au sample approximately   2274401700027 
           every 6 h. The fluctuation was determined to be small  2274401700028 
           enough not to have affected the measurements.          2274401700029

           Powder samples were wrapped in waxed paper.            2274401700031 
           The samples were located on a holder made of graphite, 2274401700032 
           and they were set at a 30 deg angle to the detector in 2274401700033 
           the target box.                                        2274401700034

METHOD     (GSPEC) The prompt and beta-delayed gamma-rays were    2274401700041 
           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during 2274401700042 
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.       2274401700043 
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector   2274401700044 
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba, 2274401700045 
           152Eu, (Firestone and Shirley, 1996; IAEA, 1991),      2274401700046

           code (GEANT4) (Agostinelli et al., 2003).              2274401700049 
           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were         2274401700050 
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122  2274401700051

           The neutron beam at the irradiation position was       2274401800021 
           approximately 14x61 mm2.                               2274401800022 
           The fluctuation of neutron flux was monitored by 198Au 2274401800023 
           activity by inserting the 197Au sample approximately   2274401800024 
           every 6 h. The fluctuation was determined to be small  2274401800025 
           enough not to have affected the measurements.          2274401800026 
SAMPLE     (79-AU-197,NAT=1.00) Natural sample for 197Au.         2274401800027 
           Metal foil samples were 10x10 mm2.                     2274401800028 
           The samples were located on a holder made of graphite, 2274401800029 
           and they were set at a 30 deg angle to the detector in 2274401800030 
           the target box.                                        2274401800031

           tmp(=ti) 13.9 hr, tmd 0.5 hr,                          2274401800034 
           tmp - time of prompt gamma measuring,                  2274401800035 
           ti - irradiation time,                                 2274401800036 
           tmd - time of beta-delayed gamma-ray measuring.        2274401800037 
METHOD     (GSPEC) The prompt and beta-delayed gamma-rays were    2274401800038 
           measured with well calibrated 22% HPGe detector during 2274401800039 
           irradiation and after irradiation, respectively.       2274401800040 
           Relative detection efficiencies of the HPGe detector   2274401800041 
           were determined using radioactive sources 56Co, 133Ba, 2274401800042 
           152Eu, (Firestone and Shirley, 1996; IAEA, 1991),      2274401800043 
           and the prompt gamma rays from the 14N(n,c)15N         2274401800044 
            (Miyazaki et al.,2008), and Monte Carlo simulation    2274401800045 
           code (GEANT4) (Agostinelli et al., 2003).              2274401800046 
           The uncertainties in the efficiency curve were         2274401800047 
           evaluated to be within 0.7% at energies between 0.122  2274401800048 
           and 5 MeV, and 1.0% above 5 MeV.                       2274401800049
