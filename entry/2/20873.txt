SAMPLE     The capture sample was a beryllium metal disk          20873  1   23 
            (weight: 49 g, purity: 99.5%) , size was 60 mm in     20873  1   24

METHOD     (TOF,PHWT) The capture cross section of 9Be was        20873  1   28 
           determined by normalizing the capture gamma-ray yield  20873  1   29 
           of 9Be to that of 197Au, which was related to the      20873  1   30 
           capture cross section of 197Au by means of a           20873  1   31 
           pulse-height weighting technique. Therefore,           20873  1   32 
           measurements were performed alternately between the    20873  1   33 
           beryllium and gold sample runs. Both data were         20873  1   34 
           normalized by neutron counts of another 6Li-glass      20873  1   35
