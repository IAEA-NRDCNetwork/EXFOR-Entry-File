FACILITY   (SYNCH,2JPNKTO) The KENS (KEK spallation neutron       22250  1    9 
            source) facility was used.                            22250  1   10 
INC-SOURCE (POLNS) A pulsed (20 Hz) 500 MeV proton beam           22250  1   11 
            bombarded U target to produce neutrons by spallation. 22250  1   12 
            A dynamically polarized proton filter  was placed at  22250  1   13 
            5.2 m from the neutron source. Incident neutrons were 22250  1   14 
            transversely polarized (70% at En=1 eV) upon          22250  1   15 
            transmission through filter. The neutron polarization 22250  1   16 
            was determined by measuring the neutron transmittance 22250  1   17 
            of the filter. The neutron spin was reversed every    22250  1   18 
            4 sec by reversing the magnetic field. The neutron    22250  1   19 
            beam was collimated to 1.8 cm diam.  The intensity was22250  1   20 
            monitored by counting the capture gamma-rays from an  22250  1   21 
            annular indium foil. The neutron energy was determined22250  1   22 
            by TOF technique.                                     22250  1   23 
SAMPLE      La-139 target was a metal column 2.5 cm in diam.      22250  1   24 
            and 3 cm in height. As the bromine target, carbon     22250  1   25 
            tetrabromide of the same size was used. All Cd-111,   22250  1   26 
            Nb-93, Pd-108 and Sn-124 targets were metal disks with22250  1   27 
            thickness 1.15,2.5,0.7 and 3 cm respectively.         22250  1   28 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) For the 1st type of measurements (see method)   22250  1   29 
            3 sets of BaF2 gamma-ray counters were used           22250  1   30 
            covering 85% of 4pi steradians.                       22250  1   31 
            B4C was used to absorb neutrons scattered from target.22250  1   32 
            In the 2nd and 3rd types of measurements, BGO scin.   22250  1   33 
            crystals were used.                                   22250  1   34 
            In all measurements, the neutron energy spectrum was  22250  1   35 
            measured using a B-10 loaded liquid scin. placed at   22250  1   36
