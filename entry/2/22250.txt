            A DYNAMICALLY POLARISED PROTON FILTER  WAS PLACED AT  2225000100013 
            5.2 M FROM THE NEUTRON SOURCE. INCIDENT NEUTRONS WERE 2225000100014

            TRANSMISSION THROUGH FILTER. THE NEUTRON POLARISATION 2225000100016 
            WAS DETERMINED BY MEASURING THE NEUTRON TRANSMITTANCE 2225000100017 
            OF THE FILTER. THE NEUTRON SPIN WAS REVERSED EVERY 4 S2225000100018

            TETRABROMIDE OF THE SAME SIZE WAS USED. ALL CD111,    2225000100026 
            NB93, PD108 AND SN124 TARGETS WERE METAL DISKS WITH   2225000100027
