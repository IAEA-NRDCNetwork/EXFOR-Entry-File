INC-SOURCE (LAMB ) Erlangen Lamb-shift polarized ion source,      2213300100014 
            delivered 11.5 MeV vector polarized deuterons onto    2213300100015 
            a deuterium gas target. The target cell was 13 mm in  2213300100016 
            diameter by 50 mm thick, and filled to a pressure of  2213300100017 
            5 bar at a temperature of 77 K. The neutron polari-   2213300100018 
            zation was reversed every 50 sec.                     2213300100019 
           (POLTR) Erlangen polarized proton target. It uses a    2213300100020 
            thin lanthanum magnesium nitrate (LMN), single crystal2213300100021 
            doped with 1% Nd at the La sites. The protons         2213300100022 
            of the crystal water molecules were polarized by      2213300100023 
            dynamic nuclear orientation at low temperatures, 1.3K,2213300100024 
            in a strong magnetic field, 1.85 T, using 70 GHz      2213300100025 
            microwaves. The LMN crystal had the shape of a slab,  2213300100026 
            300 micrometers thick and with a cross section area   2213300100027 
            of 6 by 6 mm. The distance from the center of the gas 2213300100028 
            cell to the LMN crystal was 10 cm.                    2213300100029

METHOD     (TOF  ) Time-of-flight techniques was used to obtain   2213300100031 
           (COINC) coincidences between the proton and neutron    2213300100032 
            detectors. Coincidences between the Si-detectors of   2213300100033 
            the telescope were also recorded.                     2213300100034 
           (PSD,EDE) The neutron detectors used PSD for neutron-  2213300100035 
            gamma discrimination.                                 2213300100036 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SOLST) A delta-E - E detector telescope, built  2213300100037 
            from two silicon barrier detectors, having an active  2213300100038 
            area of 12 mm in diameter and being 110 and 800 micro-2213300100039 
            meters thick, respectively, was used to detect the    2213300100040 
            recoil protons. The telescope was placed at an angle  2213300100041 
            of 45 degrees and at a distance of 6 cm from the LMN  2213300100042 
            crystal.                                              2213300100043 
           (SCIN ) A 10 cm diameter by 11.4 cm thick NE213 liquid 2213300100044 
            scintillation detector was used for neutron detection.2213300100045 
            The detector was placed at an angle of 45 degrees and 2213300100046 
            at a distance of 60 cm from the LMN cell. Two similar 2213300100047 
            detectors, one placed in the beam direction and the   2213300100048 
            other above the scattering plane served as fluence    2213300100049 
            monitors. The distance from the LMN cell to these     2213300100050 
            detectors were 3 m.                                   2213300100051 
           .The polarization of the deuteron beam was monitored   2213300100052 
            with a carbon polarimeter.                            2213300100053 
CORRECTION .The data were corrected for background by subtracting 2213300100054 
            the yield outside the time-of-flight peak. Corrections2213300100055 
            were also applied for dead-time and fluctuations in   2213300100056 
            the deuteron beam current.                            2213300100057
