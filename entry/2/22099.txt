AUTHOR     (W.Ratynski,F.Kaeppeler)                               2209900100006

FACILITY   (VDG,2GERKFK) A Van de Graaff accelerator delivered a  2209900100008 
            beam of 1912 keV protons. The accelerator was operated2209900100009 
            in a dc mode during irradiations and in pulsed mode   2209900100010 
            when obtaining the neutron energy spectrum with time- 2209900100011 
            of-flight. The beam current had a density of less than2209900100012 
            1 microamp/mm2.                                       2209900100013 
CRITIQUE   .Although the term 'Maxwellian spectrum' is used       2209900100014 
            throughout the paper this is understood in a stellar  2209900100015 
            context, the actual average cross section (<sigma>kT) 2209900100016 
            being defined as the averaged reaction rate (cross    2209900100017 
            section multiplied by velocity) divided by the mean   2209900100018 
            thermal velocity (vT) within the stellar plasma of    2209900100019 
            thermal energy kT :                                   2209900100020 
               <sigma>kT  = <sigma x velocity>/ vT                2209900100021 
            using the accepted Maxwell velocity distribution      2209900100022 
            formula the term vT can easily be shown to be         2209900100023 
            (2kT/m)**0.5, m being the reduced mass. This is equi- 2209900100024 
            valent to folding the cross section with an energy    2209900100025 
            spectrum proportional to a Maxwellian distribution    2209900100026 
            times velocity (E(n) x exp(-E(n)/kT)) with a normal-  2209900100027 
            isation factor of 2/(Pi)**0.5, instead of a true      2209900100028 
            Maxwellian (E(n)**0.5 x exp(-E(n)/kT)). it is this    2209900100029 
            former spectrum that is reproduced experimentally     2209900100030 
            using the p-Li7 source, and the resulting average     2209900100031 
            cross section without the 2/(Pi)**0.5 factor appears  2209900100032 
            in the data table.                                    2209900100033

INC-SPECT  .Near Maxwellian spectrum with kT = 25.0 +/- 0.5 keV.  2209900100037 
METHOD     (ACTIV,TOF) Activation of both gold and beryllium. By  2209900100038 
            choosing the proton energy to 1912 keV, a kinematic   2209900100039 
            collimation of 120 degrees was obtained, and the      2209900100040 
            activation of the target and the sample was thus      2209900100041 
            directly related.                                     2209900100042 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A Li-6 glass detector was used for determining  2209900100043 
            the neutron spectrum and proton energy by time-of-    2209900100044 
            flight.                                               2209900100045 
           (HPGE) A coaxial high purity germanium detector with a 2209900100046 
            peak to compton ratio of 32 and an energy resolution  2209900100047 
            of 1.7 keV at 1.33 MeV was used for measuring the     2209900100048 
            activities from gold and beryllium. The detector was  2209900100049 
            carefully efficiency calibrated with a set of         2209900100050 
            standard sources. The samples were positioned 76 mm   2209900100051 
            from the detector and typical counting times were     2209900100052 
            16 - 24 hours for gold and 1 - 2 hours for beryllium. 2209900100053

SAMPLE     .Homogeneous spherical segments of gold, having dia-   2209900100056 
            meters of about 1 cm and thicknesses of 0.02 and 0.05 2209900100057 
            mm, covering the solid angle of neutron emission,     2209900100058 
            ensured that the sample appeared equally thick to     2209900100059 
            all neutrons. The thicknesses and homogeneities were  2209900100060 
            carefully determined by several methods.              2209900100061 
           .Two cylindrical gold samples were placed to cover the 2209900100062 
            remaining part of the solid angle in order to monitor 2209900100063 
            background neutrons from scattering.                  2209900100064 
           .The samples were irradiated for 1 to 4 hours.         2209900100065 
CORRECTION .Corrections were applied for scattered background     2209900100066 
            neutrons, beryllium losses, time variation of neutron 2209900100067 
            flux during irradiations. The activity measurements   2209900100068 
            were corrected for the extended sources and the self  2209900100069 
            absorption.                                           2209900100070 
           The measured cross section is multiplied by 557/568 to 2209900100071

           than 110 keV (upper boundary of the neutron energy     2209900100073 
           obtained at the neutron source used). The correction   2209900100074 
           factor was determined based on the differential cross  2209900100075
