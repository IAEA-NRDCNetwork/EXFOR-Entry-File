            Detection of long range alpha (absorber in) and of    20127  1   20 
            fission fragments (absorber out). The absorber is     20127  1   21

MONITOR     Ternary to binary fission ratios were normalized      20127  1   23 
            to the value at the 8.78 eV resonance.                20127  1   24 
COMMENT     The lower detection level for ternary alpha particles 20127  1   25 
            was about 10 MeV. As a change in the ratios may be    20127  1   26 
            expected depending on the ternary-alpha detection     20127  1   27 
            level, a measurement with a level of about 15 MeV has 20127  1   28 
            now been done (see status).                           20127  1   29

            agreement with scattering experiments (spin values)   20127  2   13

            no contradiction with experiments on kinetic energy   20127  2   17

            Earlier measurements of the ratio did not             20127  2   19 
            significantly show this effect probably due to a too  20127  2   20 
            low ternary-alpha detection level.                    20127  2   21
