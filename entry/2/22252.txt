FACILITY   (ACCEL,2JPNOSA) The Osaka University Accelerator used. 2225200100012 
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A pulsed 14 MeV neutron source was produced      2225200100013 
            by bombarding a tritium target with a D+ beam.        2225200100014 
INC-SPECT  .The neutron activation was made cyclic. The duration  2225200100015 
            of the bursts was controlled by the D+ beam pulsing.  2225200100016 
            The beam controller was interlocked with the activity 2225200100017 
            counting system and was designed as to continuously   2225200100018 
            change the neutron burst time and the period between  2225200100019 
            bursts from 0.3ms to 54.3 ms and 0.6 ms to 108.6 ms,  2225200100020 
            respectively.                                         2225200100021 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The neutron (cyclic) activation technique was  2225200100022 
            used to measure the cross-sections.                   2225200100023 
           (TOF) The neutron energy spectrum of the irradiating   2225200100024 
            source was analysed by TOF technique using an NE213   2225200100025 
            scintillation detector as a monitor.                  2225200100026 
COMMENT    .At present, the technique is applicable only to       2225200100027 
            isotopes that emit gamma-rays.                        2225200100028 
SAMPLE     .Samples of natural lead were used, positioned at 15 cm2225200100029 
            from the neutron source and at 75 cm from the Ge      2225200100030 
            detector. They were either disks of 45 mm diameter and2225200100031 
            2 mm in thickness or hollow cylinders of dimensions,  2225200100032 
            28 mm inner diameter, 30 mm in outer diameter, 70 mm  2225200100033 
            length and 1 mm thickness.                            2225200100034 
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) The gamma activity of the irradiated samples   2225200100035 
            was measured using a Ge detector. The detector        2225200100036 
            was shielded against direct neutrons from the source  2225200100037 
            using iron, concrete, polythene and lead.             2225200100038 
           (SCIN) A NE213 liquid scintillation detector was       2225200100039 
            positioned at 75 cm from the Ge detector in order     2225200100040 
            to monitor the neutron energy spectrum.               2225200100041
