ANALYSIS   -Cross-section ratios were derived from the            2265600100079 
            experimental data following application of various    2265600100080 
            corrections. Final cross sections were deduced from   2265600100081 
            the cross section ratios and the primary standard     2265600100082 
            cross sections. When the measurements were made       2265600100083 
            relative to secondary standards or to relative neutron2265600100084 
            fluence monitors, the data were normalized to the     2265600100085 
            primary standard by specific ratio measurements of the2265600100086 
            secondary standards to the primary standard or by     2265600100087 
            calibration of the relative monitors to these         2265600100088 
            standards.                                            2265600100089 
CORRECTION - Most of correction procedures were standard.         2265600100090 
            The neutron scattering corrections were derived by    2265600100091 
            the Monte-Carlo method, computer code MCNP.           2265600100092 
            Corrections were largest for the D-T neutron source   2265600100093 
            measurements at 4-MeV deuteron energy. Correction was 2265600100094 
            11% for 49-In-115(n,inl)49-In-115-M reaction, 7% for  2265600100095 
            28-Ni-58(n,p)27-Co-58 Reaction, and less than 2%      2265600100096 
            for the remaining reactions.                          2265600100097 
            -The low-energy neutron corrections were deduced using2265600100098 
             a representation of the neutron spectrum, evaluated  2265600100099 
            cross sections for the various spectral-index monitor 2265600100100 
            reactions, and estimates of the vanadium reaction     2265600100101 
            cross-section shape. The neutron spectrum determined  2265600100102 
            by time-of-flight measurement was transformed into    2265600100103 
            a few group representation which was then adjusted by 2265600100104 
            an application of the generalized least-squares       2265600100105 
            method that employed measured reaction rates for      2265600100106

COMMENT    -The listed cross section data correspond to the       2265600200006 
            production of 21-Sc-47 by neutron bombardment of      2265600200007 
            elemental vanadium. According to the authors, below   2265600200008 
            15-MeV neutron energy the 23-V-50(N,A)21-Sc-47        2265600200009 
            reaction dominates the yield of 21-Sc-47. However,    2265600200010 
            above 15-MeV, the 23-V-51(N,N+A)47-Sc-47 is the       2265600200011 
            overwhelming contributor to 21-Sc-47 production, in   2265600200012 
            part because 23-V-51 is the dominant isotopic         2265600200013 
            component of elemental vanadium.                      2265600200014
