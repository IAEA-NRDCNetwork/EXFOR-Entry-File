ANALYSIS   -Cross-section ratios were derived from the            22656  1   79 
            experimental data following application of various    22656  1   80 
            corrections. Final cross sections were deduced from   22656  1   81 
            the cross section ratios and the primary standard     22656  1   82 
            cross sections. When the measurements were made       22656  1   83 
            relative to secondary standards or to relative neutron22656  1   84 
            fluence monitors, the data were normalized to the     22656  1   85 
            primary standard by specific ratio measurements of the22656  1   86 
            secondary standards to the primary standard or by     22656  1   87 
            calibration of the relative monitors to these         22656  1   88 
            standards.                                            22656  1   89 
CORRECTION - Most of correction procedures were standard.         22656  1   90 
            The neutron scattering corrections were derived by    22656  1   91 
            the Monte-Carlo method, computer code MCNP.           22656  1   92 
            Corrections were largest for the D-T neutron source   22656  1   93 
            measurements at 4-MeV deuteron energy. Correction was 22656  1   94 
            11% for 49-In-115(n,inl)49-In-115-M reaction, 7% for  22656  1   95 
            28-Ni-58(n,p)27-Co-58 Reaction, and less than 2%      22656  1   96 
            for the remaining reactions.                          22656  1   97 
            -The low-energy neutron corrections were deduced using22656  1   98 
             a representation of the neutron spectrum, evaluated  22656  1   99 
            cross sections for the various spectral-index monitor 22656  1  100 
            reactions, and estimates of the vanadium reaction     22656  1  101 
            cross-section shape. The neutron spectrum determined  22656  1  102 
            by time-of-flight measurement was transformed into    22656  1  103 
            a few group representation which was then adjusted by 22656  1  104 
            an application of the generalized least-squares       22656  1  105 
            method that employed measured reaction rates for      22656  1  106

COMMENT    -The listed cross section data correspond to the       2265600200006 
            production of 21-Sc-47 by neutron bombardment of      2265600200007 
            elemental vanadium. According to the authors, below   2265600200008 
            15-MeV neutron energy the 23-V-50(N,A)21-Sc-47        2265600200009 
            reaction dominates the yield of 21-Sc-47. However,    2265600200010 
            above 15-MeV, the 23-V-51(N,N+A)47-Sc-47 is the       2265600200011 
            overwhelming contributor to 21-Sc-47 production, in   2265600200012 
            part because 23-V-51 is the dominant isotopic         2265600200013 
            component of elemental vanadium.                      2265600200014
