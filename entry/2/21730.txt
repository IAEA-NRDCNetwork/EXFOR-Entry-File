SAMPLE      A thin elemental layer of B-10, 15 ug/cm2, with       21730  1   18 
            a diameter of 38 mm, prepared by evaporation on a gold21730  1   19 
            coated quartz disk, and mounted in a vacuum chamber a 21730  1   20 
            at 30 mm from the sensitive surface of the detector.  21730  1   21 
METHOD     (ASSOP) Detection of emitted alphas. Good separation   21730  1   22 
            of the two alpha peaks allows the sum of counts under 21730  1   23 
            each peak to be considered proportional to the two    21730  1   24 
            partial cross sections to the Li-7 ground and first   21730  1   25 
            excited states.                                       21730  1   26 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Gold silicon surface barrier detector, 400 mm2 21730  1   27 
            in area. The detector was outside the direct beam but 21730  1   28 
            parallel to the source.                               21730  1   29 
            The detector was operated at a reverse bias of 20 V,  21730  1   30 
            giving a depletion depth of 55 um, sufficient to      21730  1   31 
            stop all reaction products of B-10(n,alpha) but thin  21730  1   32 
            enough to limit pile up of background pulses.         21730  1   33

CORRECTION  Corrected for epithermal neutrons. The measured       21730  2    8 
            reactor spectrum value was 6.741+-0.006%, and the     21730  2    9 
            epicadmium value was 7.02+-0.08%. With the measured   21730  2   10 
            cadmium ratio of the spectrum the value for epithermal21730  2   11 
            neutrons and room background neutrons is given.       21730  2   12 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty is one standard deviation,  21730  2   13 
            primarily from statistical counting uncertainties.    21730  2   14 
            The supplementary error from background was an order  21730  2   15 
            of magnitude smaller.                                 21730  2   16
