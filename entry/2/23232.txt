METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight (TOF) to measure incident neutron 2323200100044 
           spectrum on capture sample.                            2323200100045 
           Runs with and without the 105Pd sample (sample run and 2323200100046 
           blank run) and a run with a standard gold sample (gold 2323200100047 
           run) were made cyclically in each measurement.         2323200100048 
           (PHD) PH spectra were measured for Pd-105 and Au.      2323200100049

           for the gold - 9 h, the blank runs - 31 h.             2323200100051
