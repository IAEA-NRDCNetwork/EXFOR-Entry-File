METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight (TOF) to measure incident neutron 23232  1   44 
           spectrum on capture sample.                            23232  1   45 
           Runs with and without the 105Pd sample (sample run and 23232  1   46 
           blank run) and a run with a standard gold sample (gold 23232  1   47 
           run) were made cyclically in each measurement.         23232  1   48 
           (PHD) PH spectra were measured for Pd-105 and Au.      23232  1   49 
           The total measuring times for 105Pd was about 40 h;    23232  1   50 
           for the gold - 9 h, the blank runs - 31 h.             23232  1   51 
ANALYSIS   The energy calibrations of PH spectra were performed   23232  1   52
