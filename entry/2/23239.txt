           13mm diameter, 8.5 mm thickness, about 2 g weight.     23239  1   26 
           The pellets were tightly packed in to thin polyethylene23239  1   27 
           boxes.                                                 23239  1   28

            All neodymium samples were irradiated and counted for 23239  1   31

METHOD     (ACTIV)  The angles of the irradiation positions to the23239  1   36

           respectively. The effective energies of the incident   23239  1   39 
           neutrons at each sample position were determined by the23239  1   40
