DETECTOR   (TELES,SIBAR,SIBAR) Telescope consisting of an E- and  21822  1   29 
            a dE- detector. The dE-detector was a Si(Au) surface  21822  1   30 
            barrier with a depleted zone of 26.7 microns          21822  1   31 
            thickness, a surface of 300. mm**2 and a resolution   21822  1   32 
            FWHM for the 5.486 MeV alpha-line of Am-241 of 35 keV.21822  1   33 
            The E-detector had a depleted zone of 500 microns,    21822  1   34 
            a surface of 450 mm**2, and  a resolution of 40. keV. 21822  1   35 
           It was also a Si(Au) surface barrier detector.         21822  1   36 
COMMENT    .With this thickness of the dE-detector the signal for 21822  1   37 
            the Z=1 ternary particles is completely different     21822  1   38 
            from the one for the alpha particles which allows     21822  1   39 
            thus still particle identification.                   21822  1   40 
           .Differences with formerly reported values are         21822  1   41 
            explained by the extrapolation to the lower energies  21822  1   42 
            of the alpha particle spectra which deviate           21822  1   43 
            from a Gaussian.                                      21822  1   44 
CORRECTION .In some cases the telescope was shielded with an      21822  1   45 
            Al-absorber of 20 microns thickness in order to reduce21822  1   46 
            the damage by the fission fragment bombardment.       21822  1   47
