ANALYSIS   (SHAPE)   The resonance parameters for Rh-103 were     2290600200005 
            obtained from a simultaneous shape analysis of the    2290600200006 
            capture (from 300 eV to 10millieV) and transmission   2290600200007 
            (from 300 eV to 0.5 eV) data using the REFIT-code.    2290600200008 
             The resonance energy and neutron width for each      2290600200009

COMMENT    Of Authors. Poor value of negative energy resonance are2290600200016
