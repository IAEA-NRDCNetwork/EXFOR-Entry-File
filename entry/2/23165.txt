           performing detailed MCNP5 simulations of the CACTUS    2316500100051

           different energies and then interpolating between them.2316500100054 
           The response was broadened with a broadening function  2316500100055

           less than 2 deg. The total solid angle covered by the  2316500100066

REL-REF    (O,22931002,G.Aerts+,J,PR/C,73,054610,2006)            2316500200004 
           In the range 500 keV-1 MeV there is very good agreement2316500200005 
           with variations typically of the order of 15%.         2316500200006 
           Above 1 MeV the fission cross section begins to        2316500200007 
           increase and because we are unable to distinguish      2316500200008 
           events in which fission occurs, fission gamma rays will2316500200009 
           begin to contaminate our spectra.                      2316500200010 
           Above 1 MeV the surrogate data increasingly            2316500200011 
           overestimate the ENDFB7 database values.               2316500200012 
           The major discrepancy between our measurements and     2316500200013 
           ENDFB7 occur in the range 0-500 keV, where there is a  2316500200014 
           large and increasing disagreement toward low energy as 2316500200015 
           high as 400%.                                          2316500200016 
           This discrepancy probably occurs for two reasons:      2316500200017 
           1) the mismatch in spin distributions between the      2316500200018 
           indirect and direct reactions leading to an            2316500200019 
           overestimation of the cross section because decay of   2316500200020 
           higher final nuclear l waves favors decay by gamma     2316500200021 
           emission;                                              2316500200022 
           2) the finite resolution of silicon detectors smooths  2316500200023 
           out the step function at the neutron binding energy    2316500200024 
           that we are attempting to measure and thus the measured2316500200025 
           decay probabilities are the most incorrect in this     2316500200026 
           region where the decay probability is varying extremely2316500200027 
           rapidly.                                               2316500200028
