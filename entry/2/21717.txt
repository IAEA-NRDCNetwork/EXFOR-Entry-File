INC-SOURCE (REAC) Two irradiation positions at a reactor power    21717  1   10 
            of 15 kW. Thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes at    21717  1   11 
            both positions was monitored with Co and Au flux      21717  1   12 
            monitors.                                             21717  1   13 
SAMPLE      Samples contained 1 milligram of spectroscopically    21717  1   14 
            pure In2-O3 mixed with one gram of spec. pure Al2-O3. 21717  1   15 
            Samples were irradiated with and without a 0.75 mm    21717  1   16 
            cadmium foil. After dissolution of In2-O3in HCl and   21717  1   17 
            filtering Al2-O3, gamma counting was started one week 21717  1   18 
            after irradiation to allow decay of the 54 min In-116 21717  1   19 
            and 15 hr Na-24 activities, the latter formed by the  21717  1   20 
            (N,A) reaction on Al-27.                              21717  1   21 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Triple comparator method with analysis of the  21717  1   22 
            K ratios of the three elements irradiated for         21717  1   23 
            correction for each thermal to epithermal ratio.      21717  1   24 
            After irradiation each element was dissolved and      21717  1   25 
            gamma activity measured in 20 ml glass tubes in a well21717  1   26
