INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Neutrons of the lowest three energies were     2251700100009 
           produced using the 7Li(p,n) reaction;                  2251700100010 
           (P-T) Next two energies were produced from the p-T     2251700100011 
           reaction                                               2251700100012

SAMPLE     Samples for neutron irradiation consisted of 0.8 gr of 2251700100015 
            spectroscopically pure scandium oxide in flat         2251700100016 
            thin-walled Perspex pill boxes about 0.1 cm deep      2251700100017 
            and 3 cm diam.                                        2251700100018 
            The neutron flux through the samples was determined   2251700100019 
            by sandwiching them between two parallel plate ion    2251700100020 
            chambers each containing about 3 mg of 235-U extending2251700100021 
            over an area similar to that of the scandium samples. 2251700100022

            The fission counting rate in the counters was         2251700200006 
            calibrated in terms of neutron flux by calculations   2251700200007 
            based on: the amount of 235-U present as determined   2251700200008 
            by low geometry alpha-particle assay, published       2251700200009 
            values for the fission cross section, and             2251700200010 
            experimentally determined corrections for fission     2251700200011 
            fragment counting losses due to the thickness and     2251700200012 
            non-uniformity of the 235-U foil. This calibration    2251700200013 
            was verified at 14.65 MeV by making an absolute       2251700200014 
             measurement using the usual method of counting       2251700200015 
            the associated alpha-particles from the d-T reaction. 2251700200016
