INC-SOURCE (REAC ) The samples were irradiated in the             2191700100010 
            graphite replector of the Munich research reactor     2191700100011 
INC-SPECT  .The thermal neutron flux in the irradiation position  2191700100012 
            was 1.2E+13    neutrons/cm-sq*sec                     2191700100013

            of high purity quartz which itself was sealed in      2191700100016 
            an aluminum can. The space between the ampoule and    2191700100017 
            the aluminum can was filled with coarse-grained       2191700100018

ANALYSIS   .The number of produced I-129 atoms was estimated from 2191700100030 
            the number of I-130 atoms produced in an irradiation  2191700100031 
            of the chemically separated Pb-I2. The cross section  2191700100032 
            used for the reaction 53-I-129(N,g)53-I-130 was       2191700100033

           .The number of fissions induced in the irradiated      2191700100035 
            U-235 sample was determined by an absolute            2191700100036 
            measurement of the Ce-144 content. An absolute yield  2191700100037 
            of 5.37 per cent for Ce-144 in thermal-neutron        2191700100038 
            induced fission was used.                             2191700100039
