           activity of 281.8 MBq was used. The sample was shaped  2374800100037 
           like a disk with 10 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in       2374800100038

           an Al container.                                       2374800100041 
           A dummy sample, an Al container with the identical     2374800100042 
           dimensions to the 243Am sample, including only Y2O3,   2374800100043 
           was also used for background measurements.             2374800100044 
           A carbon sample with a diameter of 10 mm and a         2374800100045 
           thickness of 0.5 mm was used as neutron scatterer      2374800100046

           measurement.                                           2374800100052

ANALYSIS   The pulse height weighting technique (PHWT) was        2374800100058 
           applied to derive the neutron capture yield.           2374800100059

           "Dummy replica sample", and "Blank (no sample) " were  2374800100061 
           used for back ground estimation.                       2374800100062 
           The neutron capture cross section of 243Am was         2374800100063 
           determined relative to the capture cross section of    2374800100064 
           197Au.                                                 2374800100065 
CORRECTION Dead Time Correction was applied with the extended     2374800100066 
           dead-time model.                                       2374800100067 
           Correction factors for self shielding and multiple     2374800100068 
           scattering were deduced using the PHITS.               2374800100069 
           Contributions of discriminated gamma-rays to the       2374800100070 
           capture yields were estimated from theoretical         2374800100071 
           calculation using the nuclear reaction model code      2374800100072 
           CCONE and detector response functions obtained         2374800100073 
           by PHITS code.                                         2374800100074 
           Contributions from the impurities to the capture       2374800100075 
           yield were calculated using the evaluated cross        2374800100076 
           sections of the impurities in JENDL-4.0.               2374800100077 
           The influence of the fission events was very small     2374800100078 
           and neglected.                                         2374800100079
