TITLE       A method for the absolute measurement of fast neutron 2002600100006 
            flux with a large liquid scintillator                 2002600100007 
FACILITY   (VDG,2SWDFOA)      Van de Graaff generator             2002600100008 
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)    Pulsed neutron beam, Li7(p,n)Be7 reaction,  2002600100009 
            Li-metal target                                       2002600100010 
           .The neutrons from the source were collimated by a     2002600100011 
            channel, 40 cm long, through a block of paraffin.     2002600100012 
SAMPLE     .Li-6 glass containing 5.07 +- 0.08% by weight. The    2002600100013 
            isotopic enrichment was 95.17 +- 0.02% in Li-6.       2002600100014 
            Its dimensions were 1.5 inch diameter, and 3/8 inch   2002600100015 
            thickness. At the same time detector.                 2002600100016 
METHOD      .A Li6-loaded glass scintillator was mounted          2002600100017 
            in the centre of a liquid scintillator tank and the   2002600100018 
            number of (n,alpha) reactions in the glass was re-    2002600100019 
            gistered for a certain integrated neutron flux        2002600100020 
            which was given by the scintillator tank.             2002600100021 
            The efficiency of the scintillator tank for an        2002600100022 
            isotropic neutron flux was well known. For the        2002600100023 
            collimated beam used here, a lead scatterer was placed2002600100024 
            in the beam, which acts as a pure isotropic scatterer.2002600100025 
            (TRN) The fraction of neutrons scattered was          2002600100026 
            determined by a transmission measurement (the total   2002600100027 
            cross section is equal to the scattering cross sect.) 2002600100028 
            in this way the incoming neutron flux can be          2002600100029 
            absolutely measured.                                  2002600100030 
           (TOF)    Time-of-flight techniques have been used to   2002600100031 
            select the primary neutrons and discriminate against  2002600100032 
            neutrons scattered in the glass, thermalized in the   2002600100033 
            tank and scattered back in the glass-detector.        2002600100034

            collimated neutron beam which was scattered by means  2002600100038 
            of a lead scatterer mounted at the center of the tank 2002600100039 
            just in front of the glass detector.                  2002600100040 
           .The flux is monitored by a current integrator on the  2002600100041 
            lithium metal target and by a Li6-I(Eu) scintillator  2002600100042 
            in a polyethylene sphere.                             2002600100043 
COMMENT    .Value somewhat lower than the value published in      2002600100044

CORRECTION .Scattering in the scintillator liquid of neutrons     2002600100049 
            scattered out of the beam increase the number of      2002600100050
