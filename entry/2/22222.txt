FACILITY   (CYCLO,2JPNTOK) THE SF CYCLOTRON OF THE INSTITUTE FOR  2222200100011 
            NUCLEAR STUDY WAS USED FOR THE NEUTRON IRRADIATION.   2222200100012 
           (VDGT,2JPNTOK) THE TANDEM VAN DE GRAAFF OF THE RESEARCH2222200100013

INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) NEUTRONS WERE PRODUCED BY BOMBARDING A 1 MM    2222200100016 
            THICK BERYLLIUM TARGET WITH 3 - 5 MICROAMP PROTON     2222200100017

            37.5 MEV. THE TARGET WAS BACKED BY A WATER COOLANT,   2222200100019 
            WHICH FULLY STOPPED THE PROTONS.                      2222200100020 
INC-SPECT  .THE SEMI-MONOENERGETIC NEUTRON SPECTRA AT 0 DEGREES   2222200100021 
            WERE MEASURED WITH A NE213 SCINTILLATOR PLACED 1.3 M  2222200100022 
            FROM THE BE TARGET. N-GAMMA DISCRIMINATION WAS USED   2222200100023 
            AND THE PULSE-HEIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS WERE UNFOLDED INTO 2222200100024 
            ENERGY SPECTRA WITH A REVISED FERDO CODE. ROOM-SCAT-  2222200100025 
            TERED NEUTRONS WERE ALSO MEASURED BY SHIELDING THE    2222200100026

METHOD     (ASEP ) THE 26-AL/27-AL RATIO WAS DETERMINED BY ACCELE-2222200100029 
            RATOR MASS SEPARATION TECHNIQUES. A STANDARD SAMPLE OF2222200100030

            IN SIZE AND 50 MU THICK, WITH PURITY 99.999 PER-CENT. 2222200100039 
            THE SAMPLES WERE IRRADIATED AT TWO POSITIONS OF 5 AND 2222200100040 
            10 CM FROM THE BE TARGET FOR ABOUT 15 HR.             2222200100041
