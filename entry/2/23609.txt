INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Spallation reaction in a mercury target        2360900100014 
           irradiated with 3-GeV protons (600 kW) .               2360900100015 
           The proton beams were supplied at a repetition rate of 2360900100016 
           25 Hz and in the "double-bunch mode".                  2360900100017 
           Produced neutrons were slowed down in a supercritical  2360900100018 
           para hydrogen moderator.                               2360900100019 
           A Cd filter was used to cut the low-energy tail of     2360900100020 
           neutron pulse.                                         2360900100021 
           To reduce gamma-rays from a large 14.4 eV s-wave       2360900100022 
           resonance, an enriched Xe-131 (84.4%) gas filter       2360900100023 
           with a pressure of 0.43 MPa, and a thickness of 76 mm  2360900100024 
           was installed upstream of the Xe-131 sample.           2360900100025 
INC-SPECT  Relative neutron flux was reconstructed using the 478  2360900100026 
           keV gamma-rays from gamma rays from the B-10 (n,alpha  2360900100027

DETECTOR   (GE,BGO) An array of Ge detector consists of two       2360900100029

SAMPLE     84.4% enriched Xe-131 gas sealed into a cylindrical    2360900100033 
           cell with a pressure of 0.43 MPa, a diameter of 49 mm  2360900100034 
           and a thickness of 76 mm.                              2360900100035 
METHOD     (TOF) Flight length: 21.5 m                            2360900100036 
CORRECTION Dead time correction was applied with a paralyzable    2360900100037 
           dead time model.                                       2360900100038 
ANALYSIS   (SHAPE) The resonance parameters of the 3.2-eV p-wave  2360900100039 
           resonance were determined by fitting the relative      2360900100040 
           gamma yeild gated with the full absorption and single  2360900100041 
           escape peaks of 7132 keV gamma rays. The 3.2-eV        2360900100042 
           p-wave resonance was fitted with the Breit-Wigner      2360900100043 
           function including the background and the s-wave       2360900100044 
           component (1/v term) . The effects of the Doppler      2360900100045 
           broadening (free gas at 295 K) and the resolution      2360900100046 
           function of ANNRI were convolved with the              2360900100047 
           Breit-Wigner function. In the fitting, the total       2360900100048 
           width of the 3.2-eV p-wave resonance was used as the   2360900100049 
           gamma width, because the neutron width of the p-wave   2360900100050 
           resonance is negligibly smaller than the gamma width.  2360900100051 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainty of resonance prameters      2360900100052 
           were deduced from the uncertainty of the fitting       2360900100053 
           result.                                                2360900100054
