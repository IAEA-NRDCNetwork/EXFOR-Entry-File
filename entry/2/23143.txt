           NE213 liquid organic scintillators of 12.7 cm diameter 2314300100030 
           and 12.7 cm thickness were employed to detect the      2314300100031 
           scattering neutrons at three angles 6., 8., 15. degrees2314300100032

SAMPLE     Sample was set 10 m downstream from the lithium target.2314300100043 
           Cylindrical samples of natural carbon (5 cm diameter x 2314300100044 
            5 cm length) were used.                               2314300100045 
METHOD     (TOF) Flight -path 15 m.                               2314300100046 
            Background was measured without sample.               2314300100047 
           (PSD) Data on the pulse height, pulse shape, and TOF   2314300100048 
           (PHD) were acquired event by event.                    2314300100049 
           Gamma-ray events were segregated from the neutron      2314300100050 
           events by PSD.                                         2314300100051 
ANALYSIS   (REDUC) By subtracting the background spectrum and     2314300100052 
           cutting off the low-TOF channels corresponding to the  2314300100053 
           inelastic events, the elastic scattering neutrons were 2314300100054 
           extracted.                                             2314300100055 
CORRECTION The cross sections were corrected by 4.0%, 5.0% and 10%2314300100056 
            at 6., 8., and 15. degrees, respectively, for         2314300100057 
           contribution of low-excitation states of sample nucleus2314300100058 
           ,e.g. 2+ state at 4.44 MeV and 3- state at 9.64 MeV for2314300100059 
           carbon. Correction factors for this contribution were  2314300100060 
           estimated by a coupled-channels calculation.           2314300100061
