FACILITY   (LINAC,2ZZZGEL) The 150 keV Geel linear accelerator.   2199800100010 
INC-SPECT  .In the capture experiment, the neutron flux were      2199800100011 
            measured by replacing the Cr-52 and Cr-53 samples     2199800100012 
            by a 0.3 cm thick 10-B(4)C slab and an independent    2199800100013 
            measurement was also performed using a 0.05 cm thick  2199800100014 
            Li-6 glass. In the case of Cr-50 the Li-6 glass was   2199800100015 
            used below 100 keV and a multiplate U-235 fission     2199800100016 
            chamber above.                                        2199800100017 
            The transmission measurements were performed with     2199800100018 
            a moderated beam for the 48.9 and 197.7 m and with    2199800100019 
            an unmoderated beam for the 387.7 m experiment.       2199800100020 
SAMPLE     .The samples were canned in thin Al containers of      2199800100021 
            either 8 cm diameter (for the capture and the 50 m    2199800100022 
            transmission measurements) or 3.5 cm diameter (for    2199800100023 
            the 200 m and 400 m transmission measurements).       2199800100024 
            the Cr-50 sample was more than 95%, the Cr-52 sample  2199800100025 
            more than 99% and the Cr-53 more than 96% enriched.   2199800100026 
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight techniques, with a 58.0 m         2199800100027 
            flight path for the capture experiment, and 48.9,     2199800100028 
            197.5 and 387.7 m for the transmission experiments.   2199800100029 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) A pair of cylindrical C6d6 scintillators of     2199800100030 
            10.2 cm diameter and 7.6 cm height for the capture    2199800100031 
            experiment.                                           2199800100032 
           (NAICR) Two 4 inch by 3 inch NaI detectors together    2199800100033 
            with a 10-B(4)C detector in the 48.9 m transmission   2199800100034 
            experiment                                            2199800100035 
           (SCIN) a 2.5 cm thick NE110 scintillator was used in   2199800100036 
            the other two transmission experiments.               2199800100037 
PART-DET   (G) Gamma rays                                         2199800100038

ANALYSIS   .The capture spectra were normalised to the area of    2199800100040 
            the 1.63 keV resonance in Cr-52 (all samples contained2199800100041 
            some Cr-52). The resonance strength for neutron       2199800100042 
            capture = 0.058 +- 0.003 milli-eV value was           2199800100043 
            determined independently with a transmission          2199800100044 
            measurement (priv. comm. A.Brusegan).                 2199800100045 
            The data were analysed with the single-level Breit-   2199800100046 
            Wigner area analysis code TACASI and the Geel version 2199800100047 
            of the  R-matrix shape fitting code FANAC.            2199800100048 
           .The code MULTI was used to analyse the Cr-50 and Cr-522199800100049 
            transmission data, and the code FANAL was used for the2199800100050 
            Cr-53 transmission data. MULTI uses R-matrix for all  2199800100051 
            L-values, whereas FANAL uses single-level Breit-Wigner2199800100052 
            for non S-wave  resonances.                           2199800100053 
CORRECTION .The capture flux measurements were corrected for      2199800100054 
            background contributions, detector efficiency, self   2199800100055 
            screening and multiple scattering effects.            2199800100056 
            In the transmission measurements, the background was  2199800100057 
            determined from the black resonance minima and the    2199800100058 
            400m data were corrected for time and beam independent2199800100059 
            room background. The 200 and 400 m data were also     2199800100060 
            corrected for the oxygen contribution.                2199800100061 
ERR-ANALYS .The standard deviations on the capture results        2199800100062 
            include the statistical and the systematic contri-    2199800100063

            which was assumed to be known to within 50 percent.   2199800100066

           .the uncertainties in the transmission results include 2199800100071 
            the statistical and the systematic errors arising from2199800100072
