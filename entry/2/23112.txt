COMMENT    Of author Bethany Goldblum (28.09.2010, 07.10.2010):   23112  1   52 
           "I don't recommend using the data in Fig.1a and Fig.2a,23112  1   53 
           because the trend suggests that the gamma-ray energy   23112  1   54 
           threshold removes contributions to decays from discrete23112  1   55 
           states and thus improves the agreement of the surrogate23112  1   56 
           measurement with the directly-measured work.           23112  1   57 
           It does not make sense to include the data from Fig1(a)23112  1   58 
           and 2(a) in the EXFOR database, because they do not    23112  1   59 
           accurately reflect the physics. They were presented to 23112  1   60 
           show the effect of the gamma-ray energy threshold on   23112  1   61 
           the extracted cross section, but the contribution from 23112  1   62 
           discrete states in Fig. 1(a) and 2(a) data skews the   23112  1   63 
           result. The presentation in the manuscript was meant to23112  1   64
