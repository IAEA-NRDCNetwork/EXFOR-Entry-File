INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) 0.5 OR 1 CM THICK NATURAL LITHIUM TARGETS. THE 2222900100011 
            PROTON BEAM WAS BENT BY A MAGNET AND STOPPED IN A     2222900100012 
            WELL-SHIELDED GRAPHITE BLOCK. THE NEUTRON BEAM WAS    2222900100013 
            SHAPED BY A SYSTEM OF THREE IRON OR BRASS COLLIMATORS.2222900100014 
            THE FIRST WAS 1.6 M LONG WITH AN INITIAL DIAMETER OF  2222900100015
