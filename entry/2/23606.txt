SAMPLE     A pellet of 7.47(10) mg (957 MBq) of Am-241 oxide      2360600100029 
           enclosed in an Al casing with 46.0 mg of Y2O3 used as  2360600100030 
           binder was used. The pellet was shaped like a disk     2360600100031 
           with 10 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The    2360600100032 
           sample was encapsulated in an Al container with 0.1-   2360600100033 
           mm-thick walls and an outer diameter of 22.0(1) mm.    2360600100034 
           A dummy sample, an Al container with the identical     2360600100035 
           dimensions to the Am-241 sample, including only Y2O3,  2360600100036 
           was also used for background measurements.             2360600100037 
           A carbon sample with a diameter of 10 mm and a         2360600100038 
           thickness of 0.5 mm was used as neutron scatterer      2360600100039 
           to subtract background.                                2360600100040 
           A gold sample with a 10 mm diameter, 0.1 mm thickness  2360600100041 
           was used for normalization.                            2360600100042 
           A boron sample with a 90.4% B-10 enrichment and a mass 2360600100043 
           86.1 mg was used to deduce a neutron spectrum.         2360600100044 
ANALYSIS   The pulse height weighting technique (PHWT) was        2360600100045 
           applied to derive the neutron capture yield.           2360600100046 
           Measurements with the carbon sample, "Dummy sample",   2360600100047 
           and "Blank (no sample) " were used for background      2360600100048 
           estimation. A measurement with the gold sample was     2360600100049 
           used for the normalization. The neutron capture cross  2360600100050 
           section of Am-241 was determined relative to the       2360600100051 
           capture cross section of Au-197 at each energy point.  2360600100052 
CORRECTION Dead time correction was applied with the extended     2360600100053 
           dead-time model. Correction factors for self           2360600100054 
           shielding and multiple scattering were deduced using   2360600100055 
           the PHITS. Contributions of discriminated gamma-rays   2360600100056 
           to the capture yields were estimated from theoretical  2360600100057 
           calculation using the nuclear reaction model code      2360600100058 
           CCONE and detector response functions. Correction      2360600100059 
           factors for fission events were deduced using the      2360600100060 
           capture and fission cross-sections of Am-241 in        2360600100061 
           JENDL-5 and the gamma-ray multiplicities for the       2360600100062 
           capture and fission reactions.                         2360600100063
