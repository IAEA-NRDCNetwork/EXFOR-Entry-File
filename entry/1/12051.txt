METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The cross section of Ce142 has been      12051  1   10 
           determined by the activation method. Samples of        12051  1   11 
           spectroscopically pure cerium oxide were sealed into   12051  1   12 
           small quartz ampoules and irradiated in a position in  12051  1   13 
           the NRX Chalk River heavy water reactor where the      12051  1   14 
           neutron spectrum was predominantly thermal. With each  12051  1   15 
           sample was enclosed a piece of fine weighed cobalt     12051  1   16 
           wire which was used as a flux monitor. After           12051  1   17 
           irradiation the cerium oxide was chemically            12051  1   18 
           separated. Disintegration rates were determined by a   12051  1   19 
           4pi counter.                                           12051  1   20
