DETECTOR   (PROPC,FISCH) Two gas proportional counters with       13426  1   18 
           silver cathodes, 2 cm dia. and 30 cm long. The         13426  1   19 
           krypton pressure was about 300 mm and methane was      13426  1   20 
           added to bring the total pressure to 1 atm.            13426  1   21 
SAMPLE     The fission foils, which consist of 0.01 microg of     13426  1   22 
           235U or 239Pu deposited on a Pt disk 0.002 inch thick  13426  1   23

METHOD     (CHSEP,FISCT) Absolute radiochemical methods, fission  13426  1   25 
           yields to half life (Y/T). Foils were mounted on       13426  1   26 
           platinum in each of the two chambers of fission        13426  1   27 
           counting apparatus. The entire assembly was then       13426  1   28 
           irradiated in the brookhaven graphite reactor for      13426  1   29 
           6-12 hr, and the fission counting rates of the foils   13426  1   30 
           were recorded continuously. After irradiation the      13426  1   31 
           85Kr was radiochemically separated from the slug,      13426  1   32 
           purified, and its activity measured by internal gas    13426  1   33 
           phase proportional counting. From these values of the  13426  1   34 
           85Kr activity and the measured number of fissions the  13426  1   35 
           fission yield was calculated.                          13426  1   36
