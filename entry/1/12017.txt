SAMPLE     Two long irradiations were carried out:                1201700100012 
           1. approximately 10 mg of spectroscopically pure Cs2CO31201700100013 
           in the M.T.R., for 140 days.                           1201700100014 
           2. approximately 10 mg of CsNO3 in the NRX reactor,    1201700100015 
           for 356 days. Two short irradiations were made, each   1201700100016 
           of 16 hr. using a position in NRX similar to that used 1201700100017 
           for the long irradiation. For these irradiations the   1201700100018 
           cesium compounds which were of spectroscopic purity,   1201700100019 
           were dried at 110.C and weighed into silica tubes which1201700100020 
           were then sealed. CsC1, 36.8 mg, was used in the first 1201700100021 
           irradiation and Cs2CO3, 32.1 mg, in the second.        1201700100022

DETECTOR   (D4PI) The Beta-counter was of conventional 4Pi design,1201700100024 
            using methane as counting gas.                        1201700100025 
           (IOCH) The monitors were irradiated in the same        1201700100026 
           capsule as the cesium samples and then, after a        1201700100027 
           decay period of 5 days the 60Co activity was measured  1201700100028
