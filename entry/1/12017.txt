SAMPLE     Two long irradiations were carried out:                12017  1   12 
           1. approximately 10 mg of spectroscopically pure Cs2CO312017  1   13 
           in the M.T.R., for 140 days.                           12017  1   14 
           2. approximately 10 mg of CsNO3 in the NRX reactor,    12017  1   15 
           for 356 days. Two short irradiations were made, each   12017  1   16 
           of 16 hr. using a position in NRX similar to that used 12017  1   17 
           for the long irradiation. For these irradiations the   12017  1   18 
           cesium compounds which were of spectroscopic purity,   12017  1   19 
           were dried at 110.C and weighed into silica tubes which12017  1   20 
           were then sealed. CsC1, 36.8 mg, was used in the first 12017  1   21 
           irradiation and Cs2CO3, 32.1 mg, in the second.        12017  1   22

DETECTOR   (D4PI) The Beta-counter was of conventional 4Pi design,12017  1   24 
            using methane as counting gas.                        12017  1   25 
           (IOCH) The monitors were irradiated in the same        12017  1   26 
           capsule as the cesium samples and then, after a        12017  1   27 
           decay period of 5 days the 60Co activity was measured  12017  1   28 
           in an ionization chamber.                              12017  1   29
