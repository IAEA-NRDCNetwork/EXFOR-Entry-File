REACTION   (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)                                   14668  2    3 
METHOD     (MANGB) The number of neutrons from the Li(p,n)        14668  2    4 
           reaction for 2.27 MeV protons incident upon a lithium  14668  2    5 
           target approximately 40 keV thick was compared with    14668  2    6 
           the number of neutrons emitted by a 200 mc Ra-Be       14668  2    7 
           source by the manganese solution method. The solution  14668  2    8 
           tank used was 2 feet in diameter and 2 feet deep. The  14668  2    9 
           strength of the Ra-Be source was taken as 1.9x10**6    14668  2   10 
           neutrons per second but this value is subject to       14668  2   11 
           change after recalibration by the Chicago group.       14668  2   12 
           Determination of the Fission Rate: the two separated   14668  2   13 
           foils, Mg-XIII-7 and Mg-C-3, were placed back to back  14668  2   14 
           l/32 inch apart in a fission chamber which allowed     14668  2   15 
           the simultaneous counting of the fissions due to each  14668  2   16 
           foils This chamber has been improved by mounting the   14668  2   17 
           first amplifier stages right below the chambers. The   14668  2   18 
           scalar bias was set so as to count all pulses more     14668  2   19 
           than twice the height of the alpha pulses. The         14668  2   20 
           chamber was mounted directly in front of the target    14668  2   21 
           at a distance of 1.864 inches from the center of the   14668  2   22 
           foils to the center of the target. The above           14668  2   23 
           comparison combined with a measurement of the angular  14668  2   24 
           asymmetry of the neutrons from lithium and an          14668  2   25 
           observation of the fissions induced in the Mg-C-3 and  14668  2   26 
           Mg-XIII-7 gives the cross-section for 235U.            14668  2   27
