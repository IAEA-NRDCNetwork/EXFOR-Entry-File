FACILITY   Nuclei were produced by Californium Rare Isotope       14685  1   13 
           Breeder Upgrade (CARIBOU) facility and measured using  14685  1   14 
           Beta-decay Paul Trap.                                  14685  1   15 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Two coaxial single-crystal HPGe detectors were  14685  1   16 
           used to detect gamma rays. Two detectors with          14685  1   17 
           relative efficiences 80% and 140% were located in the  14685  1   18 
           distance 10 cm within the ion trap. Detectors were used14685  1   19 
           to identify ions.                                      14685  1   20 
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) For beta spectroscopy two plastic    14685  1   21 
           scintillator dE-E telescopes were used. dE detector    14685  1   22 
           was 1 mm thick and 10.6 cm in diameter. E detectors    14685  1   23 
           were 10.2 cm thick and diameter of 13.3 cm. Both       14685  1   24 
           telescopes were placed approx. 105 mm from the center  14685  1   25 
           of ion trap. The left and bottom dE detectors had      14685  1   26 
           beta-energy thresholds of 76+-24 and 62+-30 keV,       14685  1   27 
           respectively.                                          14685  1   28 
           (MCPLT) Recoil ions were detected using two resistive- 14685  1   29 
           anode Chevron microchannel plate detectors with 1-ns   14685  1   30 
           timing resolution and submillimeter position           14685  1   31 
           sensitivity. Each detector area was 50.3 x 50.3 mm2    14685  1   32 
           and was located 53 mm away from the ion trap center.   14685  1   33 
METHOD     (TOF) The nuclei of interest were produced in CARIBOU  14685  1   34 
           facility and trapped for some time in ion trap.        14685  1   35 
           Fission fragments from approx. 100 mCi 252Cf source    14685  1   36 
           were thermalized in a large He filled gas catcher,     14685  1   37 
           extracted as 1+ ions, separated and delivered to       14685  1   38 
           radiofrequency quadrupole buncher. The ion bunches     14685  1   39 
           were then injected into Beta-decay Paul Trap, which is 14685  1   40 
           also a linear radiofrequency quadrupole ion trap, where14685  1   41 
           their decay was measured. Ions were periodically       14685  1   42 
           ejected from the trap to measure background.           14685  1   43 
           Time of flight of recoiled ions was determined from    14685  1   44 
           time difference between dE beta detector and MCP ion   14685  1   45 
           detector.                                              14685  1   46 
           Decay products - beta rays, gamma rays and recoiled    14685  1   47 
           ions were detected and beta-decay kinematics event by  14685  1   48 
           event reconstructed using a Monte Carlo code.          14685  1   49 
           Neutron energy was obtained from measured ion recoil   14685  1   50 
           momentum assuming that neutron and ion had equal and   14685  1   51 
           oposite momenta.                                       14685  1   52 
ANALYSIS   The beta-n branching ratios were obtained by           14685  1   53 
           comparing number of beta-ion coincidence events with   14685  1   54 
           neutron emission to the number of detected beta        14685  1   55 
           particles. Ratios were obtained from the weighted      14685  1   56 
           average of the results from the four dE-MCP detector   14685  1   57 
           pairs.                                                 14685  1   58
