METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) In order to verify that the activity     14636  1   12 
           was indeed properly assigned to Lr, extractions with   14636  1   13 
           0.1 M thenoyl trifluoroacetate (TTA) in                14636  1   14 
           methylisobutyl ketone (MIBK) were performed. The KCI   14636  1   15 
           deposit was dissolved in a buffer solution of          14636  1   16 
           monochloroacetic acid or acetic acid adjusted to pH    14636  1   17 
           ranges of 1.86 to 5.5. Extractions with TTA from       14636  1   18 
           buffer solutions of different pH were performed. The   14636  1   19 
           organic phase was dried on a Pt plate and alpha        14636  1   20 
           counted. The entire procedure required about three     14636  1   21 
           minutes. The energy histogram of the 62 fission        14636  1   22 
           events was observed. Whatever the fissioning species   14636  1   23 
           is, it has reasonably symmetric mass division with a   14636  1   24 
           total kinetic energy of about 210 MeV, which is        14636  1   25 
           calculated by taking a weighted average over the       14636  1   26 
           252Cf spectrum, normalizing to TKE=186.5 MeV for       14636  1   27 
           252Cf, and scaling the 261Lr data to it.               14636  1   28

SAMPLE     Lr-261 was poduced by Cm-248(O-18,p4n) reaction.       14636  2    4 
ANALYSIS   The fragments may come either from fission of Lr-261   14636  2    5 
           or, after electron capture, from No-261.               14636  2    6
