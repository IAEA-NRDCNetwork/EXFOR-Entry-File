INC-SPECT  Irradiations were performed in the graphite thermal    14739  1   10 
           column of the Los Alamos "water boiler" (a chain-      14739  1   11 
           reacting assembly operating mainly on thermal neutrons)14739  1   12 
           .  The ratio of activities of an indium foil without   14739  1   13 
           and with cadmium covering (cadmium ratio) at the       14739  1   14 
           position of irradiation was of the order of a          14739  1   15 
           thousand or better. Hence the neutron spectrum was     14739  1   16 
           predominately thermal.                                 14739  1   17 
SAMPLE     Metal samples of both Pu239 and U235 were available    14739  1   18 
           for this experiment. The metal samples were each       14739  1   19 
           covered with cadmium save on one face. The samples     14739  1   20 
           were sufficiently thick so that they could be          14739  1   21 
           considered essentially infinitely thick for thermal    14739  1   22 
           neutrons.                                              14739  1   23 
DETECTOR   (FISCH) The detector used was a flat parallel plate    14739  1   24 
           U235 fission chamber which was embedded in the         14739  1   25 
           paraffin. The paraffin arrangement served to increase  14739  1   26 
           the counting efficiency for fast neutrons and also     14739  1   27 
           tended to equalize the counting efficiency for         14739  1   28 
           neutrons of different initial energies.                14739  1   29 
METHOD     (INTB) The sample was attached to a string and could   14739  1   30 
           be pulled out of the center of the thermal column      14739  1   31 
           into the paraffin geometry for counting. The length    14739  1   32 
           of time it took for the sample to be pulled from the   14739  1   33 
           thermal column into the paraffin geometry was just     14739  1   34 
           under 2 seconds. Counting was therefore started 2      14739  1   35 
           seconds after the sample began to move (2-second       14739  1   36 
           runs). A second set of data was taken by starting      14739  1   37 
           the counter 5 seconds after the sample began to move   14739  1   38 
            (5-second runs).                                      14739  1   39
