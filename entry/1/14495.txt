ANALYSIS   All of the fission yields must, however, be expressed  14495  1   12 
           as upper limits for the following reasons: (a) no      14495  1   13 
           firm evidence for 42Ar or for 56 Co was found; the     14495  1   14 
           method of analyses used merely assumed that some was   14495  1   15 
           present, and (b) 37Ar, 39Ar, and 41Ar could have been  14495  1   16 
           formed by reactions of neutrons with trace impurities  14495  1   17 
           in the sample, such as (n,gamma) reactions with argon, 14495  1   18 
            (n,p) reactions with potassium, and (n,alpha)         14495  1   19 
           reactions with calcium. A reasonable upper limit to    14495  1   20 
           assign each yield is the sum of the calculated yield   14495  1   21 
           and its standard deviation.                            14495  1   22

SAMPLE     The irradiated uranium sample, a part of a reactor     14495  2    5 
           fuel plate containing approximately 2.5 mg of 235U     14495  2    6

METHOD     (CHSEP,RELFY) The sample was irradiated for 3.85 yr.   14495  2    8 
           The sample was dissolved in the presence of measured   14495  2    9 
           amounts of argon, krypton, and xenon carriers with 6N  14495  2   10 
           hydrochloric acid containing a trace of platinic       14495  2   11 
           chloride as a catalyst. The recovery of each rare gas  14495  2   12 
           was measured; chemical yields were always more than    14495  2   13 
           95%. The difference of activities of the argon         14495  2   14 
           counted through a thin window (39Ar) and internally in 14495  2   15 
           a gas counter was taken as the 37Ar activity.          14495  2   16

           background 0.026+-0.002 counts/min) was filled with the14495  5    5 
            argon.                                                14495  5    6 
SAMPLE     The irradiated uranium sample, a part of a reactor     14495  5    7 
           fuel plate containing approximately 2.5 mg of 235U     14495  5    8 
           and 125 mg of aluminum.                                14495  5    9 
METHOD     (CHSEP,RELFY) The sample was irradiated for 3.85 yr.   14495  5   10 
           The sample was dissolved in the presence of measured   14495  5   11 
           amounts of argon, krypton, and xenon carriers with 6N  14495  5   12 
           hydrochloric acid containing a trace of platinic       14495  5   13 
           chloride as a catalyst. The recovery of each rare gas  14495  5   14 
           was measured; chemical yields were always more than    14495  5   15 
           95%. 42K was allowed to grow in, the argon was removed,14495  5   16 
            and  then the 42K was counted.  No evidence for 42K   14495  5   17 
           activity  was  observed. An upper limit for 42K        14495  5   18 
           activity was determined by two methods:                14495  5   19 
            (1) the difference between a long count of the sample 14495  5   20 
           and of the background was taken as the number of       14495  5   21 
           atoms of 42K at the beginning of the count, and        14495  5   22 
            (2) a least-squares decay-curve analysis was          14495  5   23 
           performed assuming the presence of 42K and background. 14495  5   24 
           The fission yields obtained from the two methods are   14495  5   25 
            (1.1+-1.7)x10**-11% and (0.6+-0.8)x10**-11%,          14495  5   26 
           respectively.                                          14495  5   27
