INC-SPECT  The energy spectrum consists principally of thermal    14279  1   10 
           neutrons in this well-moderated reactor.               14279  1   11 
SAMPLE     The 155Fm target material was separated from its       14279  1   12 
           parent the beta emitter 255Es, which was present in    14279  1   13 
           an einsteinium fraction of the following composition:  14279  1   14 
           1.0 microg 253Es, 3.4x10**-5 microg 255Es. The         14279  1   15 
           fermium was separated from the einsteinium by elution  14279  1   16 
           from a column Dowex-50 resin with 0.4 M ammonium       14279  1   17 
           alpha-hydroxyisobutyrate solution, pH = 3.85 at 85     14279  1   18 
           degrees C. The target composition at the start of the  14279  1   19 
           irradiation was 1.43x10**9 atoms 2SSFm and             14279  1   20 
           1.21x10**10 atoms 253Es. The 253Es was present in the  14279  1   21 
           target as a contaminant because of incomplete          14279  1   22 
           chemical purification of the fermium.                  14279  1   23

REACTION   (100-FM-255(N,G)100-FM-256,,SIG,,MXW)                  14279  2    3 
METHOD     (INTB,CHSEP) The total neutron exposure was 6 h at an  14279  2    4 
           average flux of 8.6x10**13 n/cm2 sec, which was        14279  2    5 
           determined by the activation of a cobalt wire. The     14279  2    6 
           flux measurement is estimated to be accurate to +-     14279  2    7 
           10%. After removal from the reactor, the target was    14279  2    8 
           dissolved in 80% HCI - 20% ethanol solution and        14279  2    9 
           treated to remove fission products. This solution was  14279  2   10 
           saturated with HCl gas and loaded directly onto a      14279  2   11 
           Dowex-50x12 (colloidal form) ion-exchange column.      14279  2   12 
           Elution of the column with HCl-ethanol solution        14279  2   13 
           resulted in the purification of the combined           14279  2   14 
           einsteinium and fermium fraction from most fission     14279  2   15 
           products, particularly the rare earths. The decay of   14279  2   16 
           spontaneous fissions in the sample was measured by     14279  2   17 
           counting in an ionization chamber with the amplifier   14279  2   18 
           biased to record fission events only. In order to      14279  2   19 
           calculate the neutron capture cross section of 255Fm,  14279  2   20 
           the following cross section estimates were assumed     14279  2   21 
           sigma(n,fission) = 200 b; for 256Fm,                   14279  2   22 
           sigma(n,destruction) = 20 b. However, the calculation  14279  2   23 
           is insensitive to the values assumed since             14279  2   24 
           neutron-induced reactions account for only 2% of the   14279  2   25 
           destruction of 25SFm during the irradiation; the       14279  2   26 
           remainder is due to alpha decay. In the case of 256Fm, 14279  2   27 
           neutron-induced reactions account for < 10**-4 of the  14279  2   28 
           destruction rate as compared to the 157 min decay.     14279  2   29

ANALYSIS   Cross section estimate: The general trend for neutron  14279  3    4 
           capture cross sections is to decrease with an          14279  3    5 
           increase in mass number for isotopes of a given        14279  3    6 
           element on the neutron excess side of stability. An    14279  3    7 
           odd-even effect is also seen, e.g. the odd-mass        14279  3    8 
           fermium isotopes have capture cross sections somewhat  14279  3    9 
           higher than neighboring even-mass isotopes. Thus, we   14279  3   10 
           may conclude that the capture cross section of 257Fm   14279  3   11 
           for a well-thermalized reactor spectrum is less than   14279  3   12
