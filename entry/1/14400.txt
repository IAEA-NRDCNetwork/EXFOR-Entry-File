FACILITY   (REAC,1USALAS) Los Alamos fast reactor.                1440000100010 
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The beam of thermal neutrons had a flux of      1440000100011 
           5x10**5 neutrons/cm2/sec at a distance of 6 ft from    1440000100012 
           the face of the reactor pile, where the 235U foil was  1440000100013 
           placed.                                                1440000100014 
DETECTOR   The cloud chamber.                                     1440000100015 
SAMPLE     The 235U foil was 3 cm by 10 cm by 0.010 inches thick, 1440000100016 
           making the source strength of fission neutrons of      1440000100017 
           3.7x10**7 neutrons/sec.                                1440000100018 
METHOD     (REC) In order to get longer proton tracks for a       1440000100019 
           given energy in the cloud chamber, hydrogen gas was    1440000100020 
           used at a pressure of 1/3 of an atmosphere; and water  1440000100021 
           vapor was used in place of alcohol, reducing the       1440000100022 
           stopping power of vapor by a factor of about three.    1440000100023 
           The cloud chamber was placed well outside the beam of  1440000100024 
           neutrons, at a distance of 35 cm from the 235U         1440000100025 
           sample. Under the experimental conditions outlined     1440000100026 
           above, from 5 to 15 recoil protons were obtained each  1440000100027 
           time the cloud chamber expanded. 2800 pairs of         1440000100028 
           stereoscopic pictures were taken with the apparatus    1440000100029 
           and approximately 25000 recoil protons were observed.  1440000100030 
ANALYSIS   To convert from the number of proton recoils to the    1440000100031 
           number of primary neutrons one must take into account  1440000100032 
           the varying cross sections for neutron-proton          1440000100033 
           scattering. As a final correction one must multiply    1440000100034 
           by the geometrical correction factor for the           1440000100035 
           probability of measuring tracks of different lengths   1440000100036 
           to deduce the relative number of neutrons with         1440000100037 
           different energies.                                    1440000100038
