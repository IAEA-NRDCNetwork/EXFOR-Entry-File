INC-SPECT  The thermal flux which is available well back in the   12395  1    8 
           graphite block, using the cyclotron as a neutron       12395  1    9 
           source.                                                12395  1   10 
METHOD     The number of fast neutrons given off was measured by  12395  1   11 
           making a volume integral of the resonance activity     12395  1   12 
           acquired by indium foils and comparing this with a     12395  1   13 
           similar integral from a Ra-Be source of known output;  12395  1   14 
           the number of fissions was measured by counting the    12395  1   15 
           fissions from a thin foil on the face of a case        12395  1   16 
           containing the sample of fissionable material, and     12395  1   17 
           knowing the ratio of weights of material in the foil   12395  1   18 
           to material in the sample. The measurement gives a     12395  1   19 
           rather accurate value of the ratio nubar/Q where Q is  12395  1   20 
           the neutron output of Ra-Be source.                    12395  1   21 
CORRECTION The self absorption correction was calculated on the   12395  1   22 
           basis of this average counting rate plus the           12395  1   23 
           assumption of an isotropic neutron flux around the     12395  1   24 
           sample. The straight-through self-absorption in the    12395  1   25 
           sample was about 11 percent in the worst case (round   12395  1   26 
           25 sample); it becomes larger when averaged over all   12395  1   27 
           angles, but is partially monitored by the detector     12395  1   28 
           foil, one side of which is shaded by the sample. The   12395  1   29 
           net correction was 5 percent for the round 25 sample.  12395  1   30 
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Los Alamos notation uses 49 for    12395  1   31

SAMPLE     For 49 the thin foil was made by transferring          12395  3    4 
           quantitatively an aliquot of the total sample on to a  12395  3    5 
           thin platinum disk. The value thus obtained was        12395  3    6 
           checked by comparing the fission counts from this      12395  3    7 
           foil with the fission mounts from a very small 49      12395  3    8 
           foil which had been alpha-counted accurately; and      12395  3    9 
           alpha-counting a very small aliquot from the total     12395  3   10 
           sample (note that the ratio is independent of the      12395  3   11
