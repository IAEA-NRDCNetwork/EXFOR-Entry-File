FACILITY   Gammasphere array at Argonne National Laboratory       1374600100012 
SAMPLE     252Cf source (30 microCi) sandwiched between two Au    1374600100013 
            foils each 19 mg/cm**2 in thickness.  An 0.84 mg/cm**21374600100014 
            Mylar foil is placed On each side of the Cf sample.   1374600100015 
METHOD     (EDE) Energy distribution analysis.                    1374600100016 
            No reliable data was obtained for alpha energies below1374600100017 
            9.0 MeV, the low energy cutoff of the measurement.    1374600100018 
DETECTOR   (TELES) 2 DE-E Si detector telescopes installed in the 1374600100019 
            center of the Gammasphere array. Each DE-E telescope  1374600100020 
            included one DE detector (15 microns thick and 10x10  1374600100021 
            mm**2 area) and one E strip detector (400 microns     1374600100022 
            thick and 60x60 mm**2 in area) with 29 strips.        1374600100023 
           The DE and E telescopes, installed at 6 and 40 mm      1374600100024 
            from the source, respectively, provided Z and A       1374600100025 
            identification for all charged light particles.       1374600100026 
MONITOR    Energy calibration of telescopes performed with 224Ra  1374600100027 
            and 228Th radioactive source and 6.2-MeV alpha peak   1374600100028

ANALYSIS   Shape of energy spectrum of ternary alpha particles    1374600100035 
            analyzed. Low energy tail was attributed to alpha     1374600100036 
            particles originating from 5He emission. Contribution 1374600100037 
            from the breakup of 6He and 8He was neglected as <1%. 1374600100038 
           Observed energy spectra fitted with Gaussian functions 1374600100039 
            to disentangle contributions of 5He and 4He.          1374600100040 
            The only requirement of the fitting procedure is that 1374600100041 
            widths of the two Gaussian distributions have the same1374600100042 
            FWHM.                                                 1374600100043 
            The small additional spread in momentum which is      1374600100044 
            contribution of the breakup of 5He to distribution    1374600100045 
            imparted by the fission is neglected in this approach.1374600100046

CRITIQUE   ** BY AUTHOR ** Application of method with 5He-particle1374600200008 
            energy fixed at 15.4 MeV, as reported by of Cheifetz, 1374600200009 
            to data of Loveland for 252Cf, and of D'hondt et al.  1374600200010 
            and Caitucoli et al. for 235U(n,f), where the alpha   1374600200011 
            spectra extend to ~0.1MeV, leads to ternary 5He yields1374600200012 
            much larger than the 4He data and to very different   1374600200013 
            FWHM fit for the two He isotopes.  This is at variance1374600200014 
            with the experimental observation that, for ternary   1374600200015 
            particles of the same charge, widths of energy        1374600200016 
            distributions are independent of mass.                1374600200017
