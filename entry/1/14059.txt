TITLE      Neutron resonance spectroscopy of 107Ag and 109Ag      1405900100011 
FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) 800-MeV protons from the Los Alamos    1405900100012 
            Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) linac              1405900100013 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) 800 MeV protons to a proton storage ring       1405900100014 
            (PSR) and compressed to pulses of short length.       1405900100015 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The neutrons were detected by a system of 55    1405900100016 
            10B liquid scintillators located at 56 m from the     1405900100017 
            neutron source.                                       1405900100018 
SAMPLE     The natural silver (2986 g, 99.999% chemical purity)   1405900100019 
            target was formed by combining two cylinders, each    1405900100020 
            10.5 cm in diameter and of length 4.3 cm. The silver  1405900100021 
            sample was located at the exit of the neutron spin    1405900100022 
            rotation device, approximately 9.7 from the neutron   1405900100023 
            source. The target was cooled to liquid nitrogen      1405900100024 
            temperature (77 K) to reduce Doppler broadening of    1405900100025 
            the resonance.                                        1405900100026 
           An additional measurement was performed on a highly    1405900100027 
            enriched (98.29% 107Ag) sample obtained from the Oak  1405900100028 
            Ridge National Laboratory Isotopes Distribution       1405900100029 
            Office. The enriched sample was 49.813 g of silver    1405900100030 
            powder. The powder was uniformly distributed within an1405900100031 
            aluminum cylinder of diameter 8.9 cm with walls 0.05  1405900100032 
            cm thick.                                             1405900100033
