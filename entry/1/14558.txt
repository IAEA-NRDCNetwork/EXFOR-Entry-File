FACILITY   (REAC,1USAORU) Measurements were performed at the      14558  1    7 
           Oregon State University TRIGA Reactor.                 14558  1    8 
SAMPLE     Natural Pd metal of thickness 0.025 mm was used as a   14558  1    9 
           sample. Simultaneous irradiations of Au, Co, and Zr    14558  1   10 
           were done to determine the neutron flux.               14558  1   11 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma rays were observed with a high-       14558  1   12 
           purity Ge detector with efficiency of 35% compared     14558  1   13 
           with NaI at 1332 keV. The detector resolution was      14558  1   14 
           typically 1.68 keV at 1332 keV.                        14558  1   15 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used                     14558  1   16 
INC-SOURCE (THCOL)Activation were performed in reactor thermal    14558  1   17

           fluxes 7E+10 and 2E+8 n/cm2/s-1, respectively. Some    14558  1   19 
           samples were irradiated using fast pneumatic transfer  14558  1   20 
           facility with neutron fluxes 1E+13 and 3.5E+11         14558  1   21
