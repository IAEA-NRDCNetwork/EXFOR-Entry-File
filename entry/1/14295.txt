DETECTOR   (BF3) Two B10F3 neutron counters. The counters were    14295  1    9 
           6.4 cm in diameter and the active length was about 50  14295  1   10 
           cm.                                                    14295  1   11 
SAMPLE     Metallic uranium: Freshly refined natural uranium      14295  1   12 
           metal was used in the form of seven flat strips 40     14295  1   13 
           cm long, 3.4 cm wide, and 0.45 cm thick.               14295  1   14 
METHOD     (ABSFY) The uranium was surrounded by paraffin wax,    14295  1   15 
           and in holes in the wax two B10F3 neutron counters     14295  1   16 
           were placed as shown, centered about 9 cm. below the   14295  1   17 
           uranium. This pile was built on a steel frame, the     14295  1   18 
           paraffin being contained in light steel tanks so that  14295  1   19 
           the whole was demountable. A lead absorber could be    14295  1   20 
           placed on top of the pile up to 25 cm in thickness.    14295  1   21 
           The neutrons which come from one fission event are     14295  1   22 
           slowed down in the paraffin and with a mean life of    14295  1   23 
           about 150 microsec will be captured in the paraffin    14295  1   24 
           or in the boron of the counters. Neutrons recorded in  14295  1   25 
           a suitable time interval after the nuclear event will  14295  1   26 
           therefore have a common origin. But because of the     14295  1   27 
           low efficiency of such an arrangement, only a few of   14295  1   28 
           the released neutrons will be recorded. The amount of  14295  1   29 
           uranium (8.05 kg) used was much too small to produce   14295  1   30 
           a substantial number of thermal-neutron-induced        14295  1   31 
           fissions in U235 by spontaneous fission neutrons       14295  1   32 
           slowed down in the paraffin. This was checked by       14295  1   33 
           surrounding the uranium with cadmium which lowered     14295  1   34 
           the counting efficiency without producing a            14295  1   35 
           significant effect on the final results. The           14295  1   36 
           measurements are considered to apply to U238 since the 14295  1   37 
           amount of U235 and other isotopes is known to be less  14295  1   38 
           than 1% and their spontaneous fission rate is too      14295  1   39 
           small to contribute appreciably.                       14295  1   40

CORRECTION Corrections were also necessary for accidental counts  14295  1   42 
           and for dead times of the circuits wherever they       14295  1   43 
           applied.                                               14295  1   44
