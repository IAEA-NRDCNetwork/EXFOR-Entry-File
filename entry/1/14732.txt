SAMPLE     Two thicknesses of gold leaf were used. One was pure   14732  2    5 
           gold leaf of about 10 mg/cm2, the other was 25 karat,  14732  2    6

           The ionization chamber was placed in the carbon        14732  2   17 
           column about 6 feet from the cyclotron. The chamber    14732  2   18 
           was filled with nitrogen at a pressure of a 90 cm Hg.  14732  2   19 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) In calculating the probable error of the    14732  2   20
