           U3O8 and U308 prepared from commercial uranyl nitrate  14552  1   12 
           hexahydrate  were  used.  The commercial uranium was   14552  1   13 
           purified by dissolution in nitric acid followed by an  14552  1   14 
           ether extraction and subsequent ignition to U308.      14552  1   15

DETECTOR   (SCIN) Tritium was converted to water in a closed      14552  1   17 
           system and its activity measured by liquid             14552  1   18

           (NAICR) The gamma activity of the barium sample was    14552  1   20 
           measured using a 5 in. sodium iodide scintillator.     14552  1   21 
           The  counting efficiency for the 140Ba in the sodium   14552  1   22 
           iodide crystal spectrometer was determined by counting 14552  1   23 
           equal aliquots of a separated 140Ba solution           14552  1   24

           spectrometer and in the "Tri-Carb" liquid scintillation14552  1   26 
           spectrometer.                                          14552  1   27
