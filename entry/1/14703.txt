METHOD     (TRN) The source of neutrons (13 cm long and 1.78 cm   14703  2    4 
           in diameter) was placed centrally in a 1.78 cm hole    14703  2    5 
           through the axis of the cylinder. Flexible targets of  14703  2    6 
           iron or aluminum (made of small strips held together   14703  2    7 
           with Cellophane tape) fitted around the curved surface 14703  2    8 
           of the cylinders. The radioactivity induced in these   14703  2    9 
           targets was measured with a thin-walled steel          14703  2   10 
           Geiger-Muller counter. In the measurements made without14703  2   11 
            the absorbers, the geometrical conditions were        14703  2   12 
           accurately preserved by the use of identical blanks.   14703  2   13 
           When aluminum targets were used, measurements were made14703  2   14 
            alternately with and without the absorbing cylinders  14703  2   15 
           in order to eliminate the effects of any changes in    14703  2   16

ANALYSIS   The quantity measured in these experiments is the      14703 14    4 
           total cross section for all processes by which the     14703 14    5 
           neutron loses a large fraction of its energy or is     14703 14    6 
           absorbed. The values called absorption+inelastic       14703 14    7 
           scattering cross sections in the text are therefore    14703 14    8 
           more strictly cross sections for absorption+           14703 14    9 
           inelastic scattering with large energy losses. If a    14703 14   10 
           form of inelastic scattering occurs in which only a    14703 14   11 
           small fraction of the energy is lost, the experiments  14703 14   12 
           will not detect the process to any marked extent. The  14703 14   13 
           cross sections sigma have been calculated from the     14703 14   14 
           fraction transmitted T by use of the relation T=exp(-  14703 14   15

ANALYSIS   The quantity measured in these experiments is the      14703 19    4 
           total cross section for all processes by which the     14703 19    5 
           neutron loses a large fraction of its energy or is     14703 19    6 
           absorbed. The values called absorption+inelastic       14703 19    7
