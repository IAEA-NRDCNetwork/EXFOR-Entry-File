INC-SOURCE (RN-BE) A radon-beryllium source of about 600 mC       14671  1    8 
           initial strength was symmetrically located 3 cm below  14671  1    9 
           this surface. Cadmium sheet 0.45 mm thick covered the  14671  1   10 
           entire surface with the exception of a 9x9 cm opening  14671  1   11 
           at the center. For all measurements with D neutrons    14671  1   12 
           this square was covered with a plane sheet of cadmium  14671  1   13 
           0.1x10x10cm.                                           14671  1   14 
SAMPLE     The thick Rh absorbers consisted of powdered metal     14671  1   15 
           placed in containers of four-mil nickel sheet with     14671  1   16 
           the aid of a template to secure uniform thickness.     14671  1   17 
           Thinner absorbers were made to a convenient thickness  14671  1   18 
           by diluting with talc. The thinnest absorber was       14671  1   19 
           obtained by electroplating Rh on nickel. All           14671  1   20 
           absorbers were approximately 6x7 cm.                   14671  1   21 
DETECTOR   (IOCH)                                                 14671  1   22 
METHOD     (ACTIV) For the activity measurements a standard       14671  1   23 
           procedure of one-minute irradiation and one-half-      14671  1   24 
           minute interval followed by a one-minute ionization    14671  1   25 
           measurement was used. The results, therefore, while    14671  1   26 
           applying to the 44-sec. period, are independent of     14671  1   27 
           exact knowledge of the period, and the contribution    14671  1   28 
           of the longer period is sufficiently small to be       14671  1   29 
           neglected. Any data used for calculation of            14671  1   30 
           transmission values were the average of at least nine  14671  1   31 
           such activity measurements.                            14671  1   32 
ANALYSIS   The absorption curves have been analyzed by assuming   14671  1   33 
           a single sharp resonance and taking into               14671  1   34 
           consideration the angular distribution of the          14671  1   35 
           neutrons emerging from the source and the absorption   14671  1   36 
           of the neutrons and the electrons in the detector.     14671  1   37 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) From the individual measurements and their  14671  1   38 
           deviations it follows that no transmission value has   14671  1   39 
           a probable error greater than 3%                       14671  1   40
