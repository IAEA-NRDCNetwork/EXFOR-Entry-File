METHOD     (CHSEP) In the present experiment the previously used  14808001   11 
           iodine sample was irradiated simultaneously with two   14808001   12 
           normal iodine samples for 12.8 hours in the Los        14808001   13 
           Alamos homogeneous pile, just outside the BeO          14808001   14 
           reflector. Normal iodine, which is known to consist    14808001   15 
           only of stable I127, should give on slow neutron       14808001   16 
           irradiation only 25-min. I128. However, the sample     14808001   17 
           which also contained some I129 yielded several         14808001   18 
           thousand counts per minute of 12.6-hr. I130 after      14808001   19 
           irradiation. All three samples were purified           14808001   20 
           radio-chemically, mounted as AgI, and counted with a   14808001   21 
           mica-window Geiger counter. Absorption of the          14808001   22 
           radiations of the 12.5-hr. component in aluminum       14808001   23 
           indicated two beta-rays with maximum energies of 0.54  14808001   24 
           and 1.02 MeV. This compares favorably with the values  14808001   25 
           for I130 reported in the literature of 0.61 and 1.03   14808001   26

ANALYSIS   The first, is based on the fission cross section of    14808002    4 
           uranium, the fission yield of the chain of mass 129    14808002    5 
            (0.7%), the weight of uranium, the time of            14808002    6 
           irradiation, the approximate neutron flux in which     14808002    7 
           the uranium slug was irradiated, and the assumptions   14808002    8 
           that about 30% of the iodine in the slug was           14808002    9 
           extracted and that the chemical yield was also about   14808002   10 
           30%. This leads to a value of 7.6*10**15 for the       14808002   11 
           number of I129 atoms and to a value of 2.5 barns       14808002   12 
            (10**-24 cm2) for the cross section.                  14808002   13

ANALYSIS   The other method of estimation is based on an          14808003    4 
           approximate measurement of the 8.0-day I131 activity   14808003    5 
           which was present at the end of the 123-day            14808003    6 
           irradiation in the iodine sample. This assumes that    14808003    7 
           the bombardment of the uranium was steady, especially  14808003    8 
           near the end. The fission yield of I131 was taken as   14808003    9 
           2.5%. This leads to a value of 1.9*10**15 I129 atoms   14808003   10 
           and to a value of 10 barns for the cross section.      14808003   11
