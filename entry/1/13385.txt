METHOD     (CHSEP,EXTB) Two samples of natural uranium metal      13385  1   11 
           were irradiated with thermal neutrons in the N.R.X.    13385  1   12 
           The uranium was dissolved in freshly distilled nitric  13385  1   13 
           acid and, where isotope dilution was required,         13385  1   14 
           known amounts of natural Cs (Cs133) were added to      13385  1   15 
           aliquots of this solution. The uranium was separated   13385  1   16 
           from the fission products by precipitation of uranium  13385  1   17 
           tetroxide from a neutral solution of the nitrate       13385  1   18 
           using hydrogen peroxide as precipitant. The            13385  1   19 
           supernatant solution containing most of the fission    13385  1   20 
           products was concentrated by evaporation and           13385  1   21 
           transferred I directly to the ion source filament of   13385  1   22 
           a 90 degrees sector mass spectrometer.                 13385  1   23

METHOD     The cumulative yield of Cs133 has been determined      13385  2    4 
           from measurements of the number of cesium atoms        13385  2    5 
           produced during a given irradiation and a knowledge    13385  2    6 
           of the extent of the U235 fission. The number of       13385  2    7 
           cesium atoms produced was measured with the mass       13385  2    8 
           spectrometer using isotope dilution techniques.The     13385  2    9 
           number of U235 fissions was calculated from the        13385  2   10 
           change in the B10/B11 ratio in a simultaneously        13385  2   11 
           irradiated boron flux monitor: 5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7 and   13385  2   12 
           the known ratio of the neutron fission cross section.  13385  2   13
