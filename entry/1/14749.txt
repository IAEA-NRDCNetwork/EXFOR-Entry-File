INC-SOURCE (D-BE) The 90-MeV neutrons produced in the stripping   14749  1   13 
           process by bombarding a 2-inch thick beryllium target  14749  1   14 
           with 190-MeV deuterons.                                14749  1   15 
DETECTOR   (TRD) A 22-inch cloud chamber filled with helium gas   14749  1   16 
           and operated in a pulsed magnetic field of 22000 gauss.14749  1   17 
METHOD     The particles were identified by curvature and relative14749  1   18 
           ionization, or by change of curvature with range when  14749  1   19 
           they stopped in the chamber.                           14749  1   20 
ANALYSIS   A weighting factor was computed for each one and       14749  1   21 
           two-prong star analyzed, which corrects for events     14749  1   22 
           which were too slanted to be measured. Since the       14749  1   23 
           number of He3,s was uncertain because they could not   14749  1   24 
           be distinguished from He4's when the track did not     14749  1   25 
           end in the chamber, the ratio of He3/pt events was     14749  1   26 
           assumed to be the same as the ratio of sigma nn/sigma  14749  1   27 
           np at 90 MeV. The total number of events, for          14749  1   28 
           neutrons above 20 MeV, was normalized to the           14749  1   29 
           interpolated n-He4 total cross section of 0.19 b.      14749  1   30

ANALYSIS   As has been mentioned before, it was impossible to     14749  8    4 
           determine whether a single track was He3 or He4 when   14749  8    5 
           it did not end in the chamber. In order to estimate    14749  8    6 
           what fraction of all the single tracks was He'3, some  14749  8    7 
           assumption must be made regarding the He3 formation    14749  8    8 
           mechanism. Corrections, in the present investigation   14749  8    9 
           the ratio of He3 to pt events is assumed to be sigma   14749  8   10 
           nn /sigma np = sigma pp /sigma np = 1/3, which leads   14749  8   11 
           to about three times the He3 cross section.            14749  8   12
