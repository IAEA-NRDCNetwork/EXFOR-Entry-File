SAMPLE     Eight samples of natural uranium, irradiated over an   14553  1   18 
           exposure of 300-1,600 MWd/ton. The samples were derived14553  1   19 
           from experimental rods of uranium irradiated in a      14553  1   20 
           heavy-water-moderated and -cooled Savannah River       14553  1   21 
           production reactor. Samples were sectioned from each   14553  1   22 
           rod, dissolved and analyzed for tritium content.       14553  1   23 
           Sections weighing 40-80 g were cut from each rod, and  14553  1   24 
           any adherent film of tritiated deuterium oxide removed 14553  1   25 
           with a solution of sodium hydroxide. The uranium of    14553  1   26 
           each section was then dissolved in nitric acid an      14553  1   27 
           apparatus designed to collect the off-gas              14553  1   28 
           quantitatively. The collected gas was scrubbed to      14553  1   29 
           remove nitrogen oxides and then was passed through     14553  1   30 
           copper oxide combustion tube to convert any hydrogen to14553  1   31 
           water.                                                 14553  1   32
