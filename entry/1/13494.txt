FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) Heavy-water pile.                       13494  1    8 
INC-SPECT  The fluxes of thermal neutrons were obtained by        13494  1    9 
           experiment as far as possible; the maximum used was    13494  1   10 
           2.0*10**13 neutrons/cm2/sec.                           13494  1   11 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Counter had a mica end-window of mass 2.8 mg   13494  1   12 
           per cm2. The counter efficiency was found to be 7.5%   13494  1   13 
           using a standard Co60 source.                          13494  1   14 
SAMPLE     Barium carbonate (138Ba was 71.66% of natural barium   13494  1   15 
           in 1949 catalogs).                                     13494  1   16 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) It is preferable to produce the Ba139    13494  1   17 
           by neutron capture in stable Ba138 than to separate    13494  1   18 
           it from mixed fission products. Barium carbonate       13494  1   19 
            (analytical reagent grade) was irradiated in high flux13494  1   20 
            positions in the heavy water pile. To free the barium 13494  1   21 
           from lanthanum after irradiation, the procedure was    13494  1   22 
           in each case to dissolve the sample in dilute          13494  1   23 
           hydrochloric acid, and take an aliquot from which the  13494  1   24 
           barium content was determined as barium sulfate. The   13494  1   25 
           La140 samples were mounted on aluminum trays, 7.1 cm2  13494  1   26 
           area, and the activity measured with a previously      13494  1   27 
           calibrated Geiger-Muller counter. The decay curve of   13494  1   28 
           a lanthanum sample was followed for some time.         13494  1   29
