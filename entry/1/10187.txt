FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Brookhaven AGS.                        1018700100008 
INC-SOURCE (P-BE) 29.4 GeV/c protons incident on beryllium target.1018700100009 
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen target flask was made of .025 cm mylar,1018700100010 
            length = 30.5 cm, dia.= 6.35 cm.                      1018700100011 
METHOD     Angles of the proton and neutron and proton momentum   1018700100012 
            were measured and used as inputs for a fitting        1018700100013 
            program, which included error estimates on the        1018700100014 
            measured quantities.                                  1018700100015 
DETECTOR   (TRD) Scattered neutrons were detected in a thick      1018700100016 
            plate spark-chamber array while the recoil protons    1018700100017 
            were detected and momentum analyzed in a magnetic     1018700100018 
            spectrometer with thin foil spark chambers.           1018700100019 
           Neutron beam was 15 mrad with respect to primary proton1018700100020 
            beam. The distance from the internal Be target to     1018700100021 
            liquid hydrogen sample was 49.2 m. The defining       1018700100022 
            collimator was 2.54 cm in diameter and was located    1018700100023 
            34.7 m from internal Be target.                       1018700100024 
PART-DET   (N,P) Both scattered neutrons and recoil protons were  1018700100025 
            detected                                              1018700100026 
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,TOT),,SIG)                                    1018700100027 
           Normalized by fitting                                  1018700100028 
            to the zero degree point determined from the optical  1018700100029 
            theorem and existing data on the real part of the     1018700100030 
            forward scattering amplitude. The value of the total  1018700100031 
            neutron-proton cross section used was 38 mb. A linear 1018700100032 
            variation was assumed in the ratio of the real to the 1018700100033 
            imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, with      1018700100034 
            a value -0.33 near 20 GeV/c and -.45 near 5 GeV/c.    1018700100035 
CORRECTION Corrections were made for proton energy loss as it     1018700100036 
            passed through sample, for inelastics, and for target-1018700100037 
            empty events.                                         1018700100038 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) A Monte Carlo study indicated that the      1018700100039 
            uncertainty in the momentum transfer was essentially  1018700100040 
            independent of the momentum transfer and of the       1018700100041 
            incident momentum, remaining constant at +/- 0.017    1018700100042 
            (GeV/c)**2.                                           1018700100043
