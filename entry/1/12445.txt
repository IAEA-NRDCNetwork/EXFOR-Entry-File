SAMPLE     2500 grams of depleted U3O8 oxide in which the         12445  1    9 
           ratio of isotopes 238U/235U was 3800. 92 uranium       12445  1   10 
           pellets were produced. Each pellet was 2.57 cm in      12445  1   11 
           diameter, 0.70 cm in height,and weighted 20 grams.     12445  1   12 
           These were held in little Al dishes, each of which     12445  1   13 
           weighed slightly less than 2 grams. The 92 pellets     12445  1   14 
           were arranged inside a graphite brick 10 x 10 x 120    12445  1   15 
           cm long in a cubic lattice of spacing 5.21 cm, 23      12445  1   16 
           periods long.                                          12445  1   17

METHOD     (REAC,CHSEP) Reactivity coefficient measurement. The   12445  1   19 
           absorption cross section of 238U was measured by       12445  1   20 
           comparing the change in reactivity of a pile produced  12445  1   21 
           by a sample of oxide in which the isotopic ratio was   12445  1   22 
           3800, with that produced by a standard boron           12445  1   23 
           absorber. The temperature of the pile neutrons with    12445  1   24 
           which the measurement was made was found to be 381 K.  12445  1   25 
           Cd wires were used to determine neutron temperature.   12445  1   26 
           After the irradiation the pellets were dissolved in    12445  1   27 
           nitric acid. Five grams of purified material was       12445  1   28 
           pressed into a pellet and the beta-ray activity of     12445  1   29 
           the 23.5 minute half life of 239U was measured.        12445  1   30

           2.59 b. From this effect of B and Cd impurities found  12445  2    7 
           in spectrographic analysis had to be subtracted. This  12445  2    8 
           amounted to 0.006 b. The final number of 2.58 b may    12445  2    9
