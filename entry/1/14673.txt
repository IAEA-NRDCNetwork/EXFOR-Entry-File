DETECTOR   (BF3) Boron trifluoride ionization chamber.            14673  1   10 
SAMPLE     235U enriched sample, no details on 239Pu sample.      14673  1   11 
METHOD     The number of delayed neutrons from Pu239              14673  1   12 
           relative to the number from U235 has been measured by  14673  1   13 
           means of a boron trifluoride ionization chamber        14673  1   14 
           immersed in a block of paraffin. The sample of Pu239   14673  1   15 
           was placed on one end of the BFs chamber and the       14673  1   16 
           paraffin block was exposed to the direct beam of       14673  1   17 
           neutrons from the cyclotron target about 10 ft away.   14673  1   18 
           The strong neutron intensity, with the cyclotron on,   14673  1   19 
           caused the grid of the first amplifier tube to drift   14673  1   20 
           to such a negative voltage that nothing was recorded.  14673  1   21 
           However, as soon as the cyclotron was turned off the   14673  1   22 
           grid voltage would snap back to a sensitive bias       14673  1   23 
           within a few milliseconds and the amplifier system     14673  1   24 
           would then record boron disintegrations due to         14673  1   25 
           delayed neutrons. The procedure, then, was to expose   14673  1   26 
           the block to the cyclotron beam for 5 minutes and      14673  1   27 
           then to count for 5 minutes with the beam off. This    14673  1   28 
           was sufficient time for the delays to build up to      14673  1   29 
           equilibrium during exposure and to die out completely  14673  1   30 
           during the recording period. A sample of enriched      14673  1   31 
           U235 prepared in as nearly as possible the same        14673  1   32 
           geometry as the Pu239 was then substituted for the     14673  1   33 
           Pu239 and the procedure was repeated. To determine     14673  1   34 
           the contribution of the U238 in the sample, a disk of  14673  1   35 
           uranium metal was substituted for the U235 sample,     14673  1   36 
           and counts recorded. No sample at all gave no counts   14673  1   37 
           at all.                                                14673  1   38 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) A comparison ionization chamber in which       14673  1   39 
           known amounts of Pu239, enriched U235 and enriched     14673  1   40 
           U238 could be placed was inserted in the paraffin      14673  1   41 
           block in the same position that the Pu239 or U235      14673  1   42 
           sample had occupied. From the relative counts          14673  1   43 
           recorded and the known cross sections one can          14673  1   44 
           calculate that there are only 48 percent as many       14673  1   45 
           delayed neutrons per fission from Pu239 as there are   14673  1   46 
           from U235.                                             14673  1   47 
CORRECTION If one assumes the neutrons are all thermalized and    14673  1   48 
           applies a correction, the percentage of delayed        14673  1   49 
           neutrons from Pu239 relative to U235 is changed to 44  14673  1   50 
           percent.  It is difficult to draw any conclusions      14673  1   51 
           about the delayed neutrons of U238 from the data.      14673  1   52 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) However, not all the neutrons are thermal,  14673  1   53 
           so we can only say that the proper ratio lies within   14673  1   54 
           the range of 44-48 percent, and is probably about 46   14673  1   55 
           percent.                                               14673  1   56
