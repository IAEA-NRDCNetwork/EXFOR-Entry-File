DETECTOR   (FISCH,IOCH) Two chambers were used. The second        14667  1    9 
           chamber with a larger collector was used for enriched  14667  1   10 
           uranium samples which were one inch in diameter. The   14667  1   11 
           distance between the neutron source and the uranium    14667  1   12 
           sample was increased for the absolute cross-section    14667  1   13 
           determinations. The chambers were cadmium-lined as     14667  1   14 
           shown. A boron-lined ionization chamber, surrounded    14667  1   15 
           by paraffin, was used as a neutron monitor.            14667  1   16 
SAMPLE     Samples of normal uranium of various thicknesses were  14667  1   17 
           used for comparison with the enriched samples. The     14667  1   18 
           235U content of the first two samples was checked by   14667  1   19 
           comparing their UX2 beta ray yield with normal         14667  1   20 
           uranium, after the UX2 content of the samples was in   14667  1   21 
           equilibrium.                                           14667  1   22 
CORRECTION The correction for fission absorption was obtained     14667  1   23 
           from an absorption curve, determined with the use of   14667  1   24

INC-SOURCE (D-C12) Cl2(d,n) neutrons of 640 keV maximum energy.   14667  2    4 
           The carbon neutrons were produced by deuteron          14667  2    5 
           bombardment of thick graphite discs. About 99 per      14667  2    6 
           cent of these neutrons are due to the reaction         14667  2    7 
           C12(d,n) for which Q = -.28 MeV.                       14667  2    8 
SAMPLE     The measurement was made with a normal U3O8 sample of  14667  2    9 
           11 mm diameter and containing 1.140 mgm of U3O8.       14667  2   10

           the distance between the uranium sample and the        14667  2   12 
           graphite target was increased to 2.77 cm (distance to  14667  2   13 
           top surface of graphite).  The deuteron energy was     14667  2   14 
           970 keV, giving neutrons of maximum energy 665 keV in  14667  2   15

           11 mm diameter and containing 1.140 mgm of U3O8.       14667  3   10 
METHOD     For determining the absolute fission cross-section,    14667  3   11 
           the distance between the uranium sample and the        14667  3   12

ANALYSIS   To obtain the cross section for U235 for C12 neutrons, 14667  3   17 
           the natural value must be multiplied by 140 and by     14667  3   18 
           .505 the fraction of fissions due C12 neutrons for     14667  3   19 
           ordinary uranium. Dr. Way has made a more detailed     14667  3   20 
           calculation of correction for the above data and       14667  3   21
