METHOD     (SHELT) The Sphere Multiplication Measurement: In      12679  1   10 
           this measurement, the ratio M of sphere-on to          12679  1   11 
           sphere-off counting rates of an external               12679  1   12 
           flat-response long counter is obtained, the neutron    12679  1   13 
           source being located at the sphere center. Sphere      12679  1   14 
           Transmission Measurements: Offhand it would appear     12679  1   15 
           possible to obtain cross sections by the subtraction   12679  1   16 
           of reaction channels from a value of inelastic         12679  1   17 
           derivable from a sphere transmission measurement.      12679  1   18 
           However, with a light scattering material such as Li7  12679  1   19 
           there is the complication that as a result of the      12679  1   20 
           energy degradation in scattering, those neutrons       12679  1   21 
           elastically scattered in backward directions cannot    12679  1   22 
           be distinguished from those inelastically scattered    12679  1   23 
           in forward directions after excitation of low levels.  12679  1   24 
           Fortunately, most of the elastic scattering occurs     12679  1   25 
           into the so-called forward diffraction cone.           12679  1   26

ANALYSIS   By utilizing lithium spherical shell transmission and  12679  1   28 
           multiplication measurements, the Li7(n,n'g) Li7 and    12679  1   29 
           the He6-production cross sections, it is possible to   12679  1   30 
           deduce that the 14-MeV Li7(n,n'a) T cross section.     12679  1   31

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The authors mention always only    12679  1   33 
           "14 MeV neutrons" without giving details of the        12679  1   34 
           incident energy spectrum. It is quite likely that these12679  1   35 
            "14 MeV neutrons" have an energy like 14.5 MeV or so  12679  1   36 
           as it is very usual with T(d,n) neutrons. Therefore it 12679  1   37 
           is probably better to give just a value of 14.         12679  1   38
