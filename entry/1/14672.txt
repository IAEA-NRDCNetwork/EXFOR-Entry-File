INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) The neutron source was a mixture of 200 mC of  14672  1    8 
           Ra with Be, embedded 3 cm below the surface of a       14672  1    9 
           paraffin cylinder 15 cm high and 20 cm in diameter.    14672  1   10 
           Average neutron energy: 3.6 MeV (13.2 MeV max).        14672  1   11 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC)                                                14672  1   12 
METHOD     (ACTIV) In each case, sets of four Cd shielded         14672  1   13 
           detector slabs, each measuring 2.2 by 4 cm, were       14672  1   14 
           irradiated at a standard elevation of 35 mm above the  14672  1   15 
           paraffin surface in an arrangement in which they       14672  1   16 
           covered an area of 4.5x8 cm. For counting, the         14672  1   17 
           four detectors were placed on a frame which fitted     14672  1   18 
           around a thin-walled Geiger-Mueller counter. The       14672  1   19 
           counter was connected to a scale-of-eight circuit.     14672  1   20 
           The 44" period of Rh and the 54' period of In were     14672  1   21 
           used. The routine of counting and irradiation was, of  14672  1   22 
           course, strictly standardized, both with regard to     14672  1   23 
           geometrical arrangement and to timing.                 14672  1   24 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,,10.) Curves show that the ratios of widths  14672  1   25 
           and spacing have an error of less than 10 percent.     14672  1   26 
           (ERR-S,,2.) The statistical error in the               14672  1   27 
           determination of each point was less than 2 percent.   14672  1   28 
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: These measurements for the 1.259   14672  1   29 
           eV resonance in Rh-103 (100% isotopic abundance) and   14672  1   30 
           1.457 eV resonance in In-115 (95.71% isotopic          14672  1   31 
           abundance). These resonance energies (1.259 and 1.457  14672  1   32 
           eV) are not mentioned in the article.                  14672  1   33
