SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9812) The 235U target consisted of a   14513  1   12 
           2 cm diameter circular deposit of 235UF(4) on a thin   14513  1   13 
           C backing. The thickness of the 235U was 175.5 mu-g    14513  1   14 
           235U/cm2. Thickness of C backing was 100 mu-g/cm2.     14513  1   15 
           The target was tilted at 45deg with respect to the     14513  1   16 
           incident beam.                                         14513  1   17 
DETECTOR   (SI) Two arrays of four Si PIN photodiodes were used   14513  1   18 
           to detect the fission products, where the photodiodes  14513  1   19 
           were arranged on opposite sides of the beam at angles  14513  1   20 
           60deg and 120deg from the incident beam. The           14513  1   21 
           individual PIN diodes had an area of 1 cm2, and the    14513  1   22 
           detectors were 2.1 cm from the center of the target.   14513  1   23 
           The timing pulse from a Si PIN diode coupled with the  14513  1   24 
           accelerator RF signal were employed to measure the     14513  1   25 
           time of flight of each interacting neutron. The        14513  1   26 
           uncertainty of the position of the photofission peak   14513  1   27 
           in the TOF spectrum was found to be 2.4%.              14513  1   28 
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy was determined by time of         14513  1   29 
           flight. The 625 mu-s macropulse proton beam contains   14513  1   30 
           340 micropulses of width 250 ps that are spaced 1.8    14513  1   31 
           mus apart, where the macropulses had a repetition      14513  1   32 
           rate of 100 Hz. The distance from the spallation target14513  1   33 
           to the Th target was measured to be 1384.9+-1.1 cm.    14513  1   34 
           The 15R beam line with 13.85m flight path was used in  14513  1   35 
           this experiment.                                       14513  1   36 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutron beams were generated from an           14513  1   37 
           unmoderated tungsten spallation source using an        14513  1   38 
           800MeV proton beam. Neutron time of flight and energy  14513  1   39 
           was calculated via the proton accelerator pulse timing.14513  1   40 
CORRECTION Data were corrected for the pulse height defect in     14513  1   41 
           Si PIN diode detectors and the energy losses of the    14513  1   42 
           fragments in the target and backing foil               14513  1   43
