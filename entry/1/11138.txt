DETECTOR   (THRES,GEMUC) C12(n,2n) Threshold detector with 20.4   11138  1   13 
           MeV.                                                   11138  1   14 
METHOD     (TRN,ACTIV) Carbon was used as an energy-sensitive     11138  1   15 
           neutron detector. The deuteron beam was monitored by   11138  1   16 
           a graphite disk placed 1 inch in front of the target.  11138  1   17 
           Both monitor and detector were irradiated              11138  1   18 
           simultaneously to avoid corrections for bombardment    11138  1   19 
           time and fluctuations in the beam intensity. The       11138  1   20 
           detector was made by quartering a hollow graphite      11138  1   21 
           cylinder (4.5 cm long) parallel to its axis. During    11138  1   22 
           irradiation the four pieces were stacked together and  11138  1   23 
           placed longitudinally with respect to the neutron      11138  1   24 
           beam. The cross section of the detector was 1.9x1.6    11138  1   25 
           cm2 and its center was 22.4 cm from the target. The    11138  1   26 
           scatterers had a cross section of 1 sq. inch and were  11138  1   27 
           placed midway between the target and detector. After   11138  1   28 
           irradiation for 40 minutes with deuteron currents of   11138  1   29 
           50-60 microA, the monitor and detector were removed.   11138  1   30 
           The radioactivity induced in the monitor was observed  11138  1   31 
           with a Lauritsen electroscope, while the detector      11138  1   32 
           was wrapped about a thin-walled Geiger counter which   11138  1   33 
           fed into a "scale of 32" recording unit.               11138  1   34 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors of the measured cross sections   11138  1   35 
           are estimated from the consistency of the data to be   11138  1   36 
           less than 8 percent for hydrogen, 5 percent for        11138  1   37 
           carbon, and 10 percent for the other elements.         11138  1   38
