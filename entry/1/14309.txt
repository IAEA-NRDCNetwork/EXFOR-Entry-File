FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the            1430900100008 
           spallation neutron source at LANSCE Weapons Neutron    1430900100009 
           Research (WNR) facility, driven by 800-MeV linear      1430900100010 
           proton accelerator.                                    1430900100011 
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Parallel plate ionization chambers were used    1430900100012 
           for fission cross section measurements and neutron flux1430900100013 
           monitoring. The chambers can hold up to four           1430900100014 
           samples, and each sample is mounted in identical       1430900100015 
           geometry in order to perform relative cross section    1430900100016 
           measurements.                                          1430900100017 
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight was used for neutron energy       1430900100018 
           determination. Proton beam repetition rate was 20Hz,   1430900100019 
           each pulse was approx. 250ns wide. Flight path no. 5   1430900100020 
           was used for cross section measurements with fission   1430900100021 
           chambers located about 8 meters from spallation target.1430900100022 
MONITOR    (92-U-235(N,F),,SIG)                                   1430900100023 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL)Spallation reaction of tungsten target by 800   1430900100024 
           MeV protons was used as neutron source. A water        1430900100025 
           moderator shapes the neutron spectrum, and the usable  1430900100026 
           neutron energy range was from around 0.2 to 200 MeV.   1430900100027 
ANALYSIS   Ratio of unknown cross section to cross section of     1430900100028 
           235U(n,f) was measured. Ratio was converted to cross   1430900100029 
           section using the ENDF/B-VII evaluation of             1430900100030 
           235U(n,f) cross section.                               1430900100031
