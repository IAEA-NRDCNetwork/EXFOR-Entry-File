FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiments were performed at the      1430800100010 
           Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) facility in Los Alamos  1430800100011 
           Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)                        1430800100012 
SAMPLE     Natural In sample with diameter of 50 mm and           1430800100013 
           thickness of 10 mm. Distance between sample and each   1430800100014 
           detector was about 0.7 m.                              1430800100015 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) NE213 liquid organic scintillators 12.7 cm      1430800100016 
           thick and 12.7 cm in diameter were used as neutron     1430800100017 
           detectors. In the first phase of the experiment        1430800100018 
           response function of each NE213 liquid organic         1430800100019 
           scintillator was measured by recording the charge      1430800100020 
           from the photomultiplier connected to the NE213        1430800100021 
           scintillator and the time-of-flight (TOF) between the  1430800100022 
           spallation target and the neutron detector.            1430800100023 
           In experiment six detectors were used, placed at angles1430800100024 
           of 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 deg. A 10 mm thick      1430800100025 
           NE102A plastic scintillation detector was placed in    1430800100026 
           front of each neutron detector and used as             1430800100027 
           veto detector to suppress detection of charged         1430800100028 
           particles.                                             1430800100029 
           (IOCH) Ionization fission chamber with 238U was used   1430800100030 
           to determine incident neutron flux.                    1430800100031 
METHOD     (TOF) Energy of the primary neutron was determined by  1430800100032 
           time of flight between spallation target and NE213     1430800100033 
           detector. Flash gamma ray peak was used as time        1430800100034 
           reference in time of flight.                           1430800100035

INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons generated by 800 MeV protons          1430800100037 
           impinging on a tungsten spallation target. The         1430800100038 
           neutron energies covered a wide energy range up to     1430800100039 
           750 MeV.The distance between the spallation target     1430800100040 
           and the experimental room was about 90 m.              1430800100041 
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD) The energy spectra of emitted neutrons were    1430800100042 
           derived from unfolding their deposition-energy         1430800100043 
           spectra with the responses of the detectors, measured  1430800100044 
           individually for each detector.                        1430800100045
