           in a 9000 fission per second count rate with 99.7%     14477  1   13 
           being from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf.           14477  1   14 
DETECTOR   (FISCH) 252Cf fission chamber was designed and         14477  1   15 
           fabricated containing 18.4 ng of Cf. This fission      14477  1   16 
           chamber was used to compare the spectrum obtained      14477  1   17 
           with the fission chamber signal to that from the       14477  1   18 
           gamma tagging method and was shown that both spectra   14477  1   19 
           show good agreement validating the gamma tagging method14477  1   20 
           (BAF2) Four BaF2 gamma detectors were used to detect   14477  1   21 
           gamma rays. BaF2 gamma detectors are hexagonal prisms  14477  1   22 
           measuring 5 inches long and 2 inches across. The face  14477  1   23 
           of each detector was located 10 cm from the center of  14477  1   24 
           the fission sample in a square configuration with the  14477  1   25 
           detector centers located 10 inches apart.              14477  1   26 
           (SCIN) Two EJ-301 liquid scintillation detectors were  14477  1   27 
           used to detect neutrons. They were 3-inch thick by     14477  1   28 
           5-inch diameter and were placed 50 cm away from the    14477  1   29 
           center of the fission sample. This detector was used   14477  1   30 
           to measure the high energy portion of the PFNS, from   14477  1   31 
           0.5 to 7 MeV.                                          14477  1   32 
           (SCIN) The EJ-204 detector was a 0.5-inch thick by 5-  14477  1   33 
           inch diameter detector and was located 48 cm away      14477  1   34 
           from the center of the fission sample. This detector   14477  1   35 
           was used to measure the low energy portion of the      14477  1   36 
           prompt fission neutron spectrum, from 50 keV to 2 MeV. 14477  1   37 
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy spectra were measured by time-of- 14477  1   38 
           flight using gamma ray tagging with BaF2 start         14477  1   39 
           detectors. Coincidence of two out of four BaF2         14477  1   40 
           detectors was required with a timing window of 3 ns    14477  1   41 
           between the events.                                    14477  1   42
