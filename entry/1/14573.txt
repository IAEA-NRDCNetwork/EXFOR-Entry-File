FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed using the Mini-   14573  1   25 
           CAPTAIN detector at the WNR/LANSCE beam at Los Alamos  14573  1   26 
SAMPLE     Active Ar target within liquid Argon Time Projection   14573  1   27 
           Chamber was used in experiment                         14573  1   28 
DETECTOR   (TPC) For total cross section a liquid argon time      14573  1   29 
           projection chamber (TPC) - LArTPC with 400 kg of       14573  1   30 
           instrumented mass was used. In addition to the TPC,    14573  1   31 
           the detector was equipped with a photon detection      14573  1   32 
           system (PDS) consisting of 24 photomultiplier tubes    14573  1   33 
           PDS was used mainly to obtain time signal for TPC.     14573  1   34 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons with a broad energy spectrum up to    14573  1   35 
           800 MeV were produced by spallation reaction of 800    14573  1   36 
           MeV protons with Tungsten target. Macropulses with     14573  1   37 
           time width of 625 mu-s were manipulated to get         14573  1   38 
           microbunch spacing of 199 mu-s. The neutron flux was   14573  1   39 
           further reduced to get neutron flux of 1 neutron per   14573  1   40 
           macropulse to detector to prevent pile-up in TPC with  14573  1   41 
           drift time of 200 mu-s.                                14573  1   42 
METHOD     (TOF) Incident neutron energy was determined using     14573  1   43 
           time of flight method, determined by signal from PDS.  14573  1   44 
           Tracks of charged particles, produced by neutron       14573  1   45 
           interaction with liquid Argon and reconstructed using  14573  1   46 
           signals from various planes of TPC detector were used  14573  1   47 
           to determine number of neutrons in different depth     14573  1   48 
           of the active Ar target-detector.                      14573  1   49 
ANALYSIS   Cross section determination is based on fact, that     14573  1   50 
           neutron flux decreases as a function of depth in the   14573  1   51 
           detector due to neutron interactions with argon. The   14573  1   52 
           attenuation of the beam is proportional to the total   14573  1   53 
           neutron-argon cross section.                           14573  1   54 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties were determined mainly by     14573  1   55 
           simulations using Geant4 system. It was found,         14573  1   56 
           that systematic uncertainties are negligible compared  14573  1   57 
           to statistical uncertainties.                          14573  1   58
