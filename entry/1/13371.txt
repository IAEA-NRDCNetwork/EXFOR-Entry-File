SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.9372) Five fission foils, each         13371  1   12 
           containing 7.855x10**-3 microg of 93.72 percent U235,  13371  1   13 
           were prepared by the standard method. Two additional   13371  1   14 
           foils were prepared by slight variations of this       13371  1   15 
           method: one, without final ignition, to test whether   13371  1   16 
           ignition affects the escape of fission recoils; and the13371  1   17 
            other, by stippling the foil solution and rinse in    13371  1   18 
           small droplets over the surface of the Pt before       13371  1   19 
           evaporation and ignition, to test whether possible     13371  1   20 
           clumping of the U was great enough to cause loss of    13371  1   21 
           fission recoils.                                       13371  1   22 
DETECTOR   (PROPC,FISCH) The gas counters were of glass, 2 cm in  13371  1   23 
           diameter and 30 cm long, with chemically deposited     13371  1   24 
           silver cathodes whose volumes had been measured to     13371  1   25 
           within 0.2 percent.                                    13371  1   26 
METHOD     (CHSEP,INTB) Two slug solutions were prepared          13371  1   27 
           independently of each other by diluting aliquots of    13371  1   28 
           the U235 stock solution. The slug was bombarded in     13371  1   29 
           the space between the two fission foils for an hour.   13371  1   30 
           The total of the recorded fissions of each foil was    13371  1   31 
           then corrected for background and counting-rate loss,  13371  1   32 
           divided by 60 to give the foil fission rate as         13371  1   33 
           fissions per min, and multiplied by the ratio of       13371  1   34 
           slug weight to foil weight to give the slug fission    13371  1   35 
           rate.                                                  13371  1   36 
COMMENT    Surprisingly, modern T1/2 values for 133Xe and 135Xe   13371  1   37 
           are 5.2475 d and 9.14 H, respectively. Almost no       13371  1   38 
           changes in the last 65 years.                          13371  1   39

METHOD     (RELFY) In our experimental procedure two identical    13371  2    5 
           uranium samples(~40 microg U235 in each) were sealed   13371  2    6 
           into the usual quartz cells and then irradiated side   13371  2    7 
           by side in one of the pile pneumatic tubes for 0.033   13371  2    8 
           hr. The slugs were dissolved and swept with Xe         13371  2    9 
           carrier and 2 l of helium as rapidly as possible. The  13371  2   10 
           Xe of extract a collected at the bottom of the         13371  2   11 
           charcoal column was probably contaminated with some    13371  2   12 
           short-lived Kr isotopes. Therefore the first 10-15     13371  2   13 
           percent of the Xe desorbed from the column was         13371  2   14 
           discarded. The remainder was collected and put into    13371  2   15 
           counters in the usual manner.                          13371  2   16

METHOD     (BSPEC) The Xe from each run was measured into two     13371  3    4 
           counters, designated a and b, each of which was        13371  3    5 
           counted ten times, over a period of two weeks,         13371  3    6 
           starting about 10 days after irradiation, on each of   13371  3    7 
           two electronic circuits, designated 1 and 2. Eight     13371  3    8 
           different counters were used for the five runs.        13371  3    9 
ANALYSIS   The basic Xe activity datum that enters the fission    13371  3   10 
           yield calculation in a given run is the mean of the    13371  3   11 
           corrected a and b averages of that run. This gives     13371  3   12 
           the disintegration rate of the total Xe in the given   13371  3   13 
           slug 253 hr after the end of a 1-hr bombardment. Of    13371  3   14 
           this total activity, about 98.8 percent was 5.27-day   13371  3   15 
           Xe133, one percent was 2.3-day Xe133m, and the         13371  3   16 
           remaining 0.2 percent was 12.0-day Xe131m.             13371  3   17
