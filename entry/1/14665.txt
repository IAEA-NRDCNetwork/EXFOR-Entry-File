FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Production of photoneutron sources.    14665  1   12 
DETECTOR   (IOCH,GEMUC) Ionization chamber was filled with freon. 14665  1   13 
SAMPLE     The uranium samples were deposited as ammonium nitrate 14665  1   14 
           or as U3O8 on platinum discs; discs of 5 or 3.3 cm     14665  1   15 
           diameter and their distance from the bottom of the     14665  1   16 
           neutron sources varied between 3.40 cm and 1.86 cm in  14665  1   17 
           the various runs.                                      14665  1   18 
METHOD     (MANGB) For monokinetic energies photoneutron sources  14665  1   19 
           were selected; they were produced by power             14665  1   20 
           artificial gamma sources generated by Berkeley         14665  1   21 
           cyclotron. The total number of photoneutrons was       14665  1   22 
           determined by slowing them in a large bath of          14665  1   23 
           manganous sulphite, and a fraction of neutrons         14665  1   24 
           crossing the uranium sample was calculated. The        14665  1   25 
           neutron source was put immediately above an            14665  1   26 
           ionization chamber connected to a linear amplifier     14665  1   27 
           and containing the uranium samples to be investigated. 14665  1   28 
ANALYSIS   From the observed count (R) the fission cross section  14665  1   29 
           was obtained using the formula: R = sigma x Phi x S,   14665  1   30 
           where sigma is the cross section in square cm, Phi is  14665  1   31 
           the number of neutron crossing the perpendicular to    14665  1   32 
           the sample per unit of time, and S is the number of    14665  1   33 
           uranium nuclei per square cm.                          14665  1   34
