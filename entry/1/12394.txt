METHOD     (BGCT) A gold foil was irradiated in the 0.10 eV       12394  1   14 
           neutron beam directly behind the 235U foil whose       12394  1   15 
           fission counting rate was observed. The absolute       12394  1   16 
           activity of the gold foil was determined by            12394  1   17 
           comparison beta counting in a proportional counter     12394  1   18 
           with an identical gold foil which was irradiated in a  12394  1   19 
           thermal neutron beam and whose absolute activity was   12394  1   20 
           determined by beta-gamma coincidence counting. The     12394  1   21 
           235U fission cross section at 0.0253 eV is obtained    12394  1   22 
           from the previously determined shape of the fission    12394  1   23 
           cross section and the assumed 197Au capture cross      12394  1   24 
           section.                                               12394  1   25
