DETECTOR   (GEMUC,FISCH) The cylindrical fission chamber was      14735  1    7 
           constructed of l-mm-thick polyTFE and subdivided       14735  1    8 
           into four separate concentric compartments with about  14735  1    9 
           4-mm electrode spacing, by three foils of one mil      14735  1   10 
           dural. Both the inner and the outer cylindrical        14735  1   11 
           polyTFE walls were coated with acquadag on the side    14735  1   12 
           facing the dural foils, thus forming another two       14735  1   13 
           conducting surfaces.                                   14735  1   14 
SAMPLE     Two of the foils were coated on both sides with        14735  1   15 
           deposit of 0.4 mg/cm2 of U308 containing about 20 per  14735  1   16 
           cent 235U the total amount of 235U was thus about 30   14735  1   17 
           mg.                                                    14735  1   18 
METHOD     (COINC) The method adopted in our experiments was to   14735  1   19 
           observe coincidences between fission fragments in an   14735  1   20 
           ionization chamber and gamma-ray pulses in             14735  1   21 
           Geiger-Mueller counter. We have limited our study to   14735  1   22 
           fission induced by thermal neutrons. The "prompt"      14735  1   23 
           fission gamma rays which were investigated in this     14735  1   24 
           experiment, i.e., these emitted within less than 2     14735  1   25 
           microseconds of the fission process may be expected    14735  1   26 
           to originate from the highly excited fragments long    14735  1   27 
           before their radioactive decay. It is not excluded     14735  1   28 
           that some gamma rays may be emitted by the compound    14735  1   29 
           nucleus 236U before fission.                           14735  1   30
