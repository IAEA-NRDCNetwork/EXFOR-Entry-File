FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) The Californium Rare Isotope Breeder   14519  1   13 
           Upgrade facility at Argonne National Laboratory was    14519  1   14 
           used to deliver pure beams of mass-separated ions 134, 14519  1   15 
           134mSb from the spontaneous fission of approx. 1.7-Ci  14519  1   16 
           252Cf source at the CARIBU facility. A radio frequency 14519  1   17 
           quadrupole RFQ buncher containing residual helium gas  14519  1   18 
           was used to accumulate, cool, and bunch the beam with  14519  1   19 
           a timing of 100 ms between bunches.                    14519  1   20 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Decay station consisted equiped with a plastic  14519  1   21 
           scintillation detector for detection of beta rays      14519  1   22 
           with diameter of 10 cm and length of 10 cm. The        14519  1   23 
           detector has a 6-mm diameter well bored in it to       14519  1   24 
           allow the beam to implant on a 35-mm-wide              14519  1   25 
           aluminized-mylar tape which passes through a slot in   14519  1   26 
           the middle of the detector oriented at 90deg to the    14519  1   27 
           beam direction.                                        14519  1   28 
           (HPGE) Array of five high-purity germanium clover      14519  1   29 
           detectors was used mainly to determine half-lifes of   14519  1   30 
           134Sb nuclei.                                          14519  1   31 
INC-SOURCE 134mSb,134Sb ions were produced from the spontaneous   14519  1   32 
           fission of a 1.7-Ci 252Cf source at the CARIBU         14519  1   33 
           facility. The 252Cf fission fragments were             14519  1   34 
           thermalized using a large helium-filled gas catcher    14519  1   35 
           and extracted as a continuous low-energy beam of       14519  1   36 
           singly charged ions from the nozzle of this device     14519  1   37 
           using a combination of gas flow and electric fields.   14519  1   38 
           The beam was sent through an isobar separator operated 14519  1   39 
           with a mass resolution of M/dM=15000 to                14519  1   40 
           isolate 134,134mSb.                                    14519  1   41 
ANALYSIS   Ratio of the yield of the high-spin to low-spin        14519  1   42 
           nuclear states of 134mSb to 134Sb was determined from  14519  1   43 
           beta singles build-up and decay for both the short     14519  1   44 
           and long tape cycles, taking into account the          14519  1   45 
           relative efficiency for beta detection for each        14519  1   46 
           species, as well as the decay losses incurred during   14519  1   47 
           the transport time                                     14519  1   48 
CORRECTION The correction for decay prior to measurement was made.14519  1   49 
           This included 30 ms extraction time of the fission     14519  1   50 
           products from the CARIBU source to the buncher followed14519  1   51 
           by the 100 ms buncher cycle. These corrections shift   14519  1   52 
           the yield ratio by 8%.                                 14519  1   53
