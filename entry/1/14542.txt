SAMPLE     A 252Cf source (92 fissions/s) on a thin nickel foil   14542  1   10 
            (226 mu-g/cm2)                                        14542  1   11 
DETECTOR   (SCIN,SILI) A 252Cf source was sandwiched between two  14542  1   12 
           thin plastic scintillators (0.025 cm thick), and this  14542  1   13 
           was placed between two in-house fabricated Si(Li) X-ray14542  1   14 
           detectors with solid angle fractions of 0.18 each, and 14542  1   15 
           sensitive regions of 3x170 mm2 each.                   14542  1   16 
METHOD     (COINC,XSPEC) Coincident signals from the two          14542  1   17 
           scintillators indicated fission. The fission signal and14542  1   18 
            the two X-ray detector signals were required to be    14542  1   19 
           within 2.5mu-s of each other to trigger a two-parameter14542  1   20 
           accumulation system in which the outputs of each X-ray 14542  1   21 
           detector were recorded event by event on magnetic tape.14542  1   22 
           Multiple  K X-ray detection events were identified by  14542  1   23 
           coincident outputs from the two X-ray detectors and by 14542  1   24 
           a single detector output which was equal to the sum of 14542  1   25 
           several single K  X-ray detection  outputs.            14542  1   26 
ANALYSIS   A statistical model for X-ray emission was used to     14542  1   27 
           determine the element yield by letting the ratios in   14542  1   28 
           the detection rates of the various multiplicities fix  14542  1   29 
           the parameters in the model.                           14542  1   30
