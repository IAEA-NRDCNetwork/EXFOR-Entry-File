SAMPLE     The scatterers consisted of solid cylindrical bars of  14296  1   10 
           uranium metal, 3.0 cm in diameter by 35 cm long. Two   14296  1   11 
           enrichments were available to us, namely natural       14296  1   12 
           uranium (0.71% 235U) and slightly enriched             14296  1   13 
           uranium (0.92% 235U). The dummy scatterer was          14296  1   14 
           a bismuth cylinder of similar dimensions.              14296  1   15
