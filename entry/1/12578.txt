SAMPLE     Approximately 1 mg samples of this americium were      1257800100007 
           sealed in quartz capsules and irradiated in the        1257800100008 
            'rabbit' facility of the MTR.                         1257800100009 
FACILITY   (REAC,1USALRL) U235-H2O reactor, MTR.                  1257800100010 
INC-SPECT  Four irradiations of 24 hours and one of 48 hours were 1257800100011 
           made in neutron fluxes in the range                    1257800100012 
            1-2 x 10**14 neutrons/cm2/sec. The neutron fluxes     1257800100013 
           were monitored using cobalt activation standards.      1257800100014

DETECTOR   (IOCH) The alpha counting was done in an argon-filled, 1257800100016

           filled ionization chamber connected to a 50 channel    1257800100019 
           differential pulse-height analyser. The mass analyses  1257800100020
