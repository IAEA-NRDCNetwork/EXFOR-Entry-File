INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutron neutrons emerging from the      14134  1   10 
           water boiler had a cadmium ratio of about 500 and, at  14134  1   11 
           a power of 5.5 kilowatts, the flux at a position of    14134  1   12 
           the foil was 6x10**5 neutrons/cm2/sec.                 14134  1   13

SAMPLE     A 10-mil thickness of 235UO3 was coated on a 1/32-inch 14134  1   16 
           thick aluminum strip measuring 1x4 inches.             14134  1   17 
METHOD     (REC) The uranium foil was placed approximately        14134  1   18 
           perpendicular with the aluminum side facing the beam.  14134  1   19 
           Nuclear emulsion plates were placed outside of the     14134  1   20 
           neutron beam at a distance of 16 cm from the nearest   14134  1   21 
           edge of the foil. A 15-hour run at a power of 5.5 kW   14134  1   22 
           gave an appropriate proton recoil density on the       14134  1   23 
           nuclear plates. A background experiment was performed  14134  1   24 
           by removing the 235U foil and substituting a piece of  14134  1   25 
           aluminum.                                              14134  1   26 
ANALYSIS   The nuclear plates were analyzed by the method of      14134  1   27 
           measuring recoils about the a small angle of the       14134  1   28 
           forward neutron direction. In order to obtain the      14134  1   29 
           true number of proton recoil tracks, the number of     14134  1   30 
           measured tracks must be corrected for those tracks     14134  1   31 
           leaving the emulsion surfaces. The number of           14134  1   32 
           corrected proton recoil tracks is proportional to the  14134  1   33 
           collision cross section of hydrogen (sigma p) and to   14134  1   34 
           the incoming neutron flux. The neutron spectrum or     14134  1   35 
           N(E) can then be obtained after correcting the         14134  1   36 
           measured tracks for recoils leaving the emulsion       14134  1   37 
           surface and sigma p. Since it is desirable to plot the 14134  1   38 
           spectral curve in terms of neutron energy E rather     14134  1   39 
           than proton recoil energy Ep, it is necessary to       14134  1   40 
           convert the track data from Ep to E. Tracks on the     14134  1   41 
           background plate were less than 5% of the number of    14134  1   42 
           measured tracks on the regular data plate. Therefore,  14134  1   43 
           the background was neglected in the analysis of the    14134  1   44 
           data. Unfortunately, this method does not allow to     14134  1   45 
           discriminate between prompt and delayed neutrons.      14134  1   46
