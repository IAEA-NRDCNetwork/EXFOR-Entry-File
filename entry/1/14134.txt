INC-SOURCE (REAC) Thermal neutron neutrons emerging from the      1413400100010 
           water boiler had a cadmium ratio of about 500 and, at  1413400100011 
           a power of 5.5 kilowatts, the flux at a position of    1413400100012 
           the foil was 6x10**5 neutrons/cm2/sec.                 1413400100013 
DETECTOR   (PLATE) Ilford C2 nuclear emulsion plates, 100 microns 1413400100014 
           thick.                                                 1413400100015 
SAMPLE     A 10-mil thickness of 235UO3 was coated on a 1/32-inch 1413400100016 
           thick aluminum strip measuring 1x4 inches.             1413400100017 
METHOD     (REC) The uranium foil was placed approximately        1413400100018 
           perpendicular with the aluminum side facing the beam.  1413400100019 
           Nuclear emulsion plates were placed outside of the     1413400100020 
           neutron beam at a distance of 16 cm from the nearest   1413400100021 
           edge of the foil. A 15-hour run at a power of 5.5 kW   1413400100022 
           gave an appropriate proton recoil density on the       1413400100023 
           nuclear plates. A background experiment was performed  1413400100024 
           by removing the 235U foil and substituting a piece of  1413400100025 
           aluminum.                                              1413400100026 
ANALYSIS   The nuclear plates were analyzed by the method of      1413400100027 
           measuring recoils about the a small angle of the       1413400100028 
           forward neutron direction. In order to obtain the      1413400100029 
           true number of proton recoil tracks, the number of     1413400100030 
           measured tracks must be corrected for those tracks     1413400100031 
           leaving the emulsion surfaces. The number of           1413400100032 
           corrected proton recoil tracks is proportional to the  1413400100033 
           collision cross section of hydrogen (sigma p) and to   1413400100034 
           the incoming neutron flux. The neutron spectrum or     1413400100035 
           N(E) can then be obtained after correcting the         1413400100036 
           measured tracks for recoils leaving the emulsion       1413400100037 
           surface and sigma p. Since it is desirable to plot the 1413400100038 
           spectral curve in terms of neutron energy E rather     1413400100039 
           than proton recoil energy Ep, it is necessary to       1413400100040 
           convert the track data from Ep to E. Tracks on the     1413400100041 
           background plate were less than 5% of the number of    1413400100042 
           measured tracks on the regular data plate. Therefore,  1413400100043 
           the background was neglected in the analysis of the    1413400100044 
           data. Unfortunately, this method does not allow to     1413400100045 
           discriminate between prompt and delayed neutrons.      1413400100046
