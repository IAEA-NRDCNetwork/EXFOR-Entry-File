            of 5E+5 n/(cm**2 s).                                  1375700100011

ANALYSIS   After determination of the background, the numbers of  1375700100020 
            tritons and alphas were estimated for each of the 2pi 1375700100021 
            measurements and normalized to the average number of  1375700100022 
            particles observed in the forward and backward        1375700100023 
            distributions. This was done under the assumption     1375700100024 
            that, to the first approximation, tritons and alphas  1375700100025 
            are emitted in opposite directions in the laboratory  1375700100026 
            system.                                               1375700100027 
           From the number of tritons and alphas emitted in each  1375700100028 
            of the experimental conditions were determined the    1375700100029 
            degree of asymmetry involved in each case:            1375700100030 
            forward-to-backward 0 deg and 45 deg 2pi asymmetry,   1375700100031 
            forward-to-backward 0 deg ~0.6pi (45 deg cone)        1375700100032 
            asymmetry, defined as the ratio of the number of      1375700100033 
            tritons in this directions.                           1375700100034
