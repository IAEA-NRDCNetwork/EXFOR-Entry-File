DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutron detector system consists of two Eljen   1431100100012 
           Technology Model 510-50X70X138/301 EJ-301 liquid       1431100100013 
           scintillator modules. Each module has an inner vol-    1431100100014 
           ume dimension of 17.78 cm high, 35.05 cm long and      1431100100015 
           12.7 cm thick. Two Photonis XP4572B photomultiplier    1431100100016 
           tubes are mounted on each module to optimize light     1431100100017 
           collection throughout the detector volume. Two         1431100100018 
           modules are stacked on top of each other to give a     1431100100019 
           total detection area of 35.56 cm high by 35.05 cm wide.1431100100020 
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission method was used to determine total  1431100100021 
           cross section                                          1431100100022 
INC-SOURCE (PHOTO) Neutrons were produced using a pulsed          1431100100023 
           electron beam from the linear accelerator striking     1431100100024 
           the water cooled tantalum plates in the neutron        1431100100025 
           producing target. The high energy electrons from the   1431100100026 
           linear accelerator generate bremsstrahlung X-rays      1431100100027 
           within the target which interact with the tantalum to  1431100100028 
           produce photoneutrons. The RPI target was placed       1431100100029 
           on-axis with the flight tube and was used without a    1431100100030 
           moderator to enhance neutron production in the energy  1431100100031 
           range of interest. The repetition rate was 400 pulses  1431100100032 
           per second with a pulse width of approximately 8       1431100100033 
           nsec. The average electron current on the target was   1431100100034 
           about 5 mu-A with energy of 58 MeV.                    1431100100035
