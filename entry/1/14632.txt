FACILITY   (LINAC,1USAANL) Studied precursors were were produced  14632  1   13 
           at the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade        14632  1   14 
            (CARIBU) facility from the spontaneous fission of a   14632  1   15 
           approx. 100-mCi 252Cf source.The fission products      14632  1   16 
           thermalized in helium buffer gas and extracted from    14632  1   17 
           the exit nozzle of the gas catcher. Ions were then     14632  1   18 
           focused into the RFQ section and accelerated to 36 keV.14632  1   19 
DETECTOR   Ions of interest were studied using the Beta-decay Paul14632  1   20 
           Trap (BPT), an open-geometry linear radio frequency    14632  1   21 
           quadrupole (RFQ) ion trap designed for precision       14632  1   22 
           beta-decay studies. BPT was used to collect and suspend14632  1   23 
           radioactive ions of interest at the center of detector 14632  1   24 
           array. The detector array consisted of                 14632  1   25 
           (TELES,SCIN,SCIN) Two plastic scintillation telescopes 14632  1   26 
            with EJ-204 plastic scintillators were used to detect 14632  1   27 
            beta particles. dE detector has diameter of 10.6mm and14632  1   28 
            1 mm thickness. E detector was 10.2cm thick with 13.3 14632  1   29 
            cm diameter.                                          14632  1   30

             to detect gamma rays                                 14632  1   39 
METHOD     Ions of interest were produced by spontaneous fission  14632  1   40 
           of 252Cf, captured by the BPT ion trap and their decay 14632  1   41
