DETECTOR   (SCIN) The final volume of the purified tritiated water14531  1   13 
           was measured to determine the recovery yield           14531  1   14 
            (essentially always 100%) of the aqueous added to the 14531  1   15 
           samples as HNO3 and NaOH solutions.                    14531  1   16 
           Aliquotes of this water were counted in a coincidence  14531  1   17 
           type liquid  scintillation counter. Using a dioxane    14531  1   18 
           base scintillas, or solution with 2 ml of the water in 14531  1   19 
           15 ml of the dioxane solution the counting efficiency  14531  1   20 
           for tritium was 11%. Changes in the counting efficiency14531  1   21 
           due to quenching by impurities in the sample and/or    14531  1   22 
           decomposition of the dioxane were monitored by the     14531  1   23

           The  233U3O8 ether extractions and the use of platinum 14531  2   14 
           metal irradiation capsules removed the possibility of  14531  2   15

           Several grams of 238U3O8 were also purified by ether   14531  2   18 
           extraction cycles. This sample was 99.983 atom% 238U   14531  2   19 
           and only 0.017 atom% 235U. This depleted U3O8 was mixed14531  2   20 
           with the 233U308 to give a weight ratio of 238U to 233U14531  2   21 
           of approximately 10:1.                                 14531  2   22 
           Samples of 0.5 to 1.5g of the 10:1  238,233U308  were  14531  2   23 
           weighed into platinum irradiation capsules which were  14531  2   24 
           sealed to prevent any gas leaks. These were then       14531  2   25 
           irradiated.                                            14531  2   26

SAMPLE     Of the six PuO2 samples measured three gave values near14531  3    4 
           that which could be expected from the Z2/A dependency. 14531  3    5 
           The experimental values obtained on these three samples14531  3    6 
           are presented. The other three values indicated lower  14531  3    7 
           tritium yields. A big differences between the values   14531  3    8 
           and a large error were because of the difficulty of    14531  3    9
