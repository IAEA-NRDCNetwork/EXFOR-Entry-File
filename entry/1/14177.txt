FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the            1417700100013 
           Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)using 800    1417700100014

DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma rays were detected with the GEANIE    1417700100016 
           spectrometer, located about 20 m from the neutron      1417700100017 
           source on the 60deg right flight path. For this        1417700100018 
           experiment, the GEANIE spectrometer consisted of 11    1417700100019 
           planar and 15 25% High- purity Ge (HPGe) coaxial       1417700100020 
           detectors. All of the planars and 9 of the coaxial     1417700100021 
           detectors were equipped with Compton suppression       1417700100022 
           shields. The detectors were situated at a distance of  1417700100023 
           approx. 14 cm from the focal point where the           1417700100024 
           scattering sample was located.                         1417700100025 
METHOD     (TOF) neutron energy determined by time of flight      1417700100026 
           method. Detection time of the "flash" of gamma rays    1417700100027 
           caused by the spallation reaction was used as a        1417700100028 
           reference marker. The detection time of the gamma rays 1417700100029 
           produced by neutrons interacting with the sample was   1417700100030 
           used to calculate the time of flight.                  1417700100031

            A fission chamber containing  235,238U located 2m     1417700100034 
            upstream from the GEANIE spectrometer was used to     1417700100035 
            determine the neutron flux.                           1417700100036 
           (26-FE-56(N,INL)26-FE-56,PAR,SIG,G) Cross section for  1417700100037 
             production of 847 keV gamma transition was used      1417700100038 
             for checking purposes in several runs. For this      1417700100039 
             purpose the 150Sm sample was sandwiched between      1417700100040 
             0.2mm Fe foils.                                      1417700100041 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Pulsed neutron beam was produced via           1417700100042 
           spallation on a natural W target by an 800-MeV proton  1417700100043 
           linear accelerator beam. The average proton beam       1417700100044 
           current at the spallation target was about 1 - 2       1417700100045 
           mu-A. The neutron beam structure contained 625 mu-s    1417700100046 
           long 'macropulses' driven by two of every three such   1417700100047 
           macropulses from the accelerator for an average rate   1417700100048 
           of 40/s. Each macropulse consisted of 'micropulses'    1417700100049 
           spaced every 1.8 mu-s, each <1 ns long. The pulsed     1417700100050 
           beam allowed incident neutron energies to be           1417700100051 
           determined using the time-of-flight technique.         1417700100052
