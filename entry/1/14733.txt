SAMPLE     Six foils of 235U and four foils of 239Pu were used    14733  2    4 
           in the experiment. All the foils were deposited on 1   14733  2    5 
           or 2 mil Pt. All the weights are based on a half life  14733  2    6 
           for 239Pu of 24,400 years.                             14733  2    7 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) In order to find any systematic errors in   14733  2    8 
           counting, a 239Pu foil and a 235U foil were compared   14733  2    9 
           under conditions obtained by separately interchanging  14733  2   10 
           scalars, amplifiers, and foils, and by moving the      14733  2   11 
           chamber within the block. No significant change in     14733  2   12 
           the counting ratio were detected. No further details   14733  2   13 
           on how the given uncertainty was determined.           14733  2   14
