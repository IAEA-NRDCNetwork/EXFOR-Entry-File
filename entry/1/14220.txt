SAMPLE     The copper and aluminum samples and the empty can      14220  1   13 
           used to derive the net 235U and manganese              14220  1   14 
           reactivities were unaltered. The same 252Cf source     14220  1   15 
           was used. The amounts of uranium and manganese-copper  14220  1   16 
           alloy were increased approximately fourfold, to        14220  1   17 
           compensate partially for the reduced signal caused by  14220  1   18 
           the absence of thermalneutron effects. These new       14220  1   19 
           samples were all 12.7 x 2.5 cm, with These new         14220  1   20 
           samples were all 12.7 x 2.5 cm, with thicknesses of    14220  1   21 
           0.005 cm for the uranium and 0.015 cm for the          14220  1   22 
           manganese - copper. The oscillated uranium sample      14220  1   23 
           weighed 2.7247 g and the four uranium samples used     14220  1   24 
           for the absolute fission-rate determination were all   14220  1   25 
           within 1.2% of this mass. The four manganese - copper  14220  1   26 
           samples which were first oscillated and subsequently   14220  1   27 
           irradiated ranged from 3.4 to 4.2 g.                   14220  1   28 
METHOD     (MANGB) The experimental procedure requires the        14220  1   29 
           measurement of 1) the relative reactivities rhoi of    14220  1   30 
           samples of 235U, 252Cf, and manganese; 2) the          14220  1   31 
           absolute capture rate for manganese RMn, and fission   14220  1   32 
           rate for 235U, R25f; and 3) the spontaneous neutron    14220  1   33 
           emission rate S for the 252Cf sample. The manganese    14220  1   34 
           and 252Cf are used to establish the importance of      14220  1   35 
           absorbed and fission neutrons, respectively. The only  14220  1   36 
           additional information required is the number of       14220  1   37 
           neutrons per 235U fission, nu25. When the results are  14220  1   38 
           normalized to the same power level, the effective      14220  1   39 
           capture-to-fission ratio:                              14220  1   40
