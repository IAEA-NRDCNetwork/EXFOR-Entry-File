SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure, normal chromium, 9.5% 53Cr.    14814001   12 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) "Spec. pure" normal chromium was         14814001   13 
           irradiated for about 13.4 hours in the fast neutron    14814001   14 
           flux of the Los Alamos Water Boiler. Vanadium was      14814001   15 
           chemically separated from the chromium and the         14814001   16 
           vanadium sample counted in a beta proportional         14814001   17 
           counter. This sample had a maximum beta activity of    14814001   18 
           approximately 3 cpm which might be attributed to       14814001   19 
           23-hour V53. No measurable gamma activity was present. 14814001   20 
ANALYSIS   Assuming 5 MeV to be a reasonable value for the        14814001   21 
           effective threshold for 53Cr(n,p) reaction and using   14814001   22 
           what is considered to be the approximate value of the  14814001   23 
           flux of neutrons greater than 5 MeV, an approximate    14814001   24 
           limit of the average cross section for this reaction   14814001   25 
           was calculated to be approximately 3.4*10**-5 mb.      14814001   26

           Compiler's comment: As the title of the paper already  14814001   28 
           suggests, a 23 hr V-53 state is still unknown.         14814001   29
