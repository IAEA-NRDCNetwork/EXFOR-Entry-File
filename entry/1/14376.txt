SAMPLE     (26-FE-54,ENR=0.96) F-82H alloy composition is 7.1Cr-  1437600100012 
           1.8W-0.55Si-0.40Mn-0.17V-0.1C-0.04Ta. 54Fe in the      1437600100013 
           alloy compromised  96% of the iron or 86% of the total 1437600100014 
           alloy by weight.                                       1437600100015

METHOD     (AMS) Alloy samples were analyzed for helium content at1437600100017 
           Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The helium      1437600100018 
           content of each specimen was determined by             1437600100019 
           isotope-dilution gas mass spectroscopy following       1437600100020 
           vaporization in a high-temperature vacuum furnace.     1437600100021 
           Hydrogen measurements were performed using a newly     1437600100022 
           developed quadrupole mass spectrometer system at PNNL. 1437600100023 
           An early experiment showed that the                    1437600100024 
           accelerated He(appm)/dpa ratio of about 2.3 was        1437600100025 
           achieved for 96% enriched 54Fe in iron in the High     1437600100026 
           Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), ORNL. Finally, the        1437600100027 
           ferritic steel He(appm)/dpa ratio was studied in the   1437600100028 
           neutron spectrum of HFIR with the 55Fe thermal         1437600100029 
           neutron helium production taken into account. A        1437600100030 
           benchmark calculation for the same sample, as used in  1437600100031 
           the aforementioned experiment, was then used to        1437600100032 
           adjust and evaluate the 55Fe(n,a) cross section        1437600100033 
           values in TALYS-based Evaluated Nuclear Data Library.  1437600100034 
ANALYSIS   Results were, initially, compared to                   1437600100035 
           calculations using isotopic helium production cross    1437600100036 
           sections from ENDF/B-VI or GNASH and measured neutron  1437600100037 
           spectra. Finally, the analysis of the benchmark TENDL  1437600100038 
           calculation showed that a decrease of a factor of      1437600100039 
           6700 for the TENDL 55Fe(n,a) cross section in the      1437600100040 
           intermediate and low energy regions was required in    1437600100041 
           order to fit the experimental results. The best fit    1437600100042 
           to the cross section value at thermal neutron energy   1437600100043 
           was about 27 mb. With the adjusted 55Fe(n,a) cross     1437600100044 
           sections, calculation showed that the 54Fe and 55Fe    1437600100045 
           isotopes could be enriched by the isotopic tailoring   1437600100046 
           technique in a ferritic steel sample irradiated in     1437600100047 
           HFIR to significantly enhance the helium production    1437600100048 
           rate. This new calculation can be used to guide        1437600100049 
           future isotopic tailoring experiments designed to      1437600100050 
           increase the He(appm)/dpa ratio in fission reactors.   1437600100051
