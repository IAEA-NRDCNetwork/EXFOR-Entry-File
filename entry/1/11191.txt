METHOD     (TOF) Neutrons slowed down in paragon are detected by  11191  1   13 
           BF3 proportional counters. Excellent collimation is    11191  1   14 
           obtained by using an extensive B4C and Cd collimating  11191  1   15 
           system. Experiments were conducted principally at a    11191  1   16 
           5.4-meter source detector distance. A special          11191  1   17 
           selector system counts all the neutrons detected and   11191  1   18 
           also selectively counts those detected in an           11191  1   19 
           adjustable timed interval after the cyclotron burst.   11191  1   20 
           The slow neutron energy distributions from paraffin    11191  1   21 
           "source" slabs were shown to be of a modified          11191  1   22 
           Maxwellian form with an asymmetrical high energy tail. 11191  1   23 
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Plots were digitized vs. neutron   11191  1   24 
           time of flight in  microsec/meter and converted to     11191  1   25 
           energy by compiler using the relation                  11191  1   26 
           E = (72.3/t)**2 eV which gives the neutron             11191  1   27 
           energy for a timing t, microsec/meter from. Formula    11191  1   28 
           was taken from Phys. Rev. 71, 165 (1947) and verified  11191  1   29 
           using the method of visual inspection. Transmission    11191  1   30 
           data are more reliable, while cross section scale is   11191  1   31 
           less obvious.                                          11191  1   32

SAMPLE     A 2.464 g/cm2 sample of B203 was used.                 11191  3    4 
METHOD     For the measurements below 100 microseconds/meter the  11191  3    5 
           total resolution width was 20 microseconds/meter plus  11191  3    6 
           3.7 percent of the time-of-flight due to the counter   11191  3    7 
           length. For the remainder of the measurements a 5000-  11191  3    8 
           microsecond cycle was used with cyclotron and          11191  3    9 
           detection, on-time widths of 100 microseconds each     11191  3   10 
           below 500 microseconds/meter and 150 microseconds      11191  3   11 
           each above 500 microseconds/meter. In calculating the  11191  3   12 
           total resolution width above 200 microseconds/meter    11191  3   13 
           the delayed thermal emission width of 45 microseconds  11191  3   14 
           and the 3.7 percent effect due to the counter length   11191  3   15 
           must be added to the sum of the cyclotron and          11191  3   16 
           detection on-time intervals.                           11191  3   17 
ANALYSIS   The results of these measurements together with an     11191  3   18 
           estimate of the overall uncertainty present may be     11191  3   19
