FACILITY   (REAC,1USAANL) Argonne heavy-water pile.               12248001    8 
SAMPLE     Radium used in early measurements was not purified     12248001    9 
           and taken directly as radium chloride. Spectrographic  12248001   10 
           analysis showed 0.4% of Ba, 0.2% of Ca, 0.04% of Mg,   12248001   11 
           and 0.02% of Si. The second sample was prepared from   12248001   12 
           20 mg of radium chloride that has been passed through  12248001   13 
           10 crystallization cycles. Spectrographic analysis     12248001   14 
           showed no significant impurities.                      12248001   15 
METHOD     Two samples, each weighing 100 microg were evaporated  12248001   16 
           on platinum plates and tested for fission in the       12248001   17 
           thermal column of heavy-water pile. One had 43         12248001   18 
           fission per minute, and another one had 18 fission     12248001   19 
           per minute over the background of 100 fission per      12248001   20 
           minute. Comparison with fission standards indicated    12248001   21 
           cross sections of 2.6x10-4 and 1.1x10-4 b. The lowest  12248001   22 
           value was taken and assumed that that fission cross    12248001   23 
           section is no more than 1.1x10-4 b.                    12248001   24
