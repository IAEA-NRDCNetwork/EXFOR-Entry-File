INC-SOURCE (P-BE) 10-MeV protons on 9Be to approximate a prompt   10640  1   11 
            fission neutron spectrum.                             10640  1   12 
METHOD     2-second cycle consisting of a 1.0-sec irradiaiton     10640  1   13 
            followed by a 0.080-sec delay and a 1.0-sec counting  10640  1   14 
            period with a 0.020-sec wait.                         10640  1   15 
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Proton-recoil proportional counters            10640  1   16 
MONITOR    Detectors calibrated using 3He(n,p)3H reaction         10640  1   17 
CORRECTION Corrected for energy-dependent detector efficiencies   10640  1   18 
            and for carbon-recoil events in the methane detector. 10640  1   19 
           Not corrected for finite detector size and field       10640  1   20 
            effects (correction about 5%), or for possible bias   10640  1   21 
            resulting from lead shield.                           10640  1   22 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Includes counting statistics and the slope- 10640  1   23 
            taking interval used to differentiate the recoil      10640  1   24 
            spectra.                                              10640  1   25 
           Error does not include the variance reduction realized 10640  1   26 
            by the digital filter which would decrease their      10640  1   27 
            magnitude by a factor of 2 to 4.                      10640  1   28
