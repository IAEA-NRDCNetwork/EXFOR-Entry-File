SAMPLE     The U238 in the form of U323808 of 110,000:1 isotopic  12448  1   11 
           abundance was on a thin aluminum hemisphere which was  12448  1   12 
           concentric with another thin but larger aluminum       12448  1   13 
           hemisphere. The two aluminum hemispheres constitute    12448  1   14 
           an ionization chamber which detects the U238 fission   12448  1   15 
           fragments.                                             12448  1   16 
METHOD     By means of measurements with a double ionization      12448  1   17 
           chamber, the average fission cross section of U238     12448  1   18 
           for neutrons from the fission of U235 was determined   12448  1   19 
           in terms of nu, the average number of neutrons per     12448  1   20 
           fission of U235. The number of fissions of U238 was    12448  1   21 
           measured in one of the ionization chambers while the   12448  1   22 
           number of fissions from the fission neutron source of  12448  1   23 
           U235 was measured in the other chamber.                12448  1   24 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The standard deviations of the mean of the  12448  1   25 
           measurements and does not include uncertainties in     12448  1   26 
           neutron scattering calculations, in the calculations   12448  1   27 
           of unobserved U238 fissions, or in the method of       12448  1   28 
           background measurements. The largest uncertainty in    12448  1   29 
           these measurements is 235U mass and number of 235U     12448  1   30 
           fission neutrons.                                      12448  1   31 
CORRECTION Several corrections of several percent or less for     12448  1   32 
           neutron absorption and neutron scattering must be      12448  1   33 
           applied. Corrections are necessary for absorption and  12448  1   34 
           scattering of thermal neutrons in the platinum and     12448  1   35 
           Dural between the U deposit and the U235 disc.         12448  1   36 
           Corrections are necessary because fission neutrons     12448  1   37 
           were, in addition, scattered to the U238 by the        12448  1   38 
           reactor face, the outside case of the chamber, and     12448  1   39 
           the various hemispheres within the case. In addition,  12448  1   40 
           the absorption of the fission neutrons by the cadmium  12448  1   41 
           and the inner aluminum hemisphere was taken into       12448  1   42 
           account. The largest of these corrections is 2 to 3%   12448  1   43 
           for the scattering of neutrons from the hemisphere     12448  1   44 
           containing U238; that is, a greater effective          12448  1   45 
           thickness of U238 is "seen" by the deflected fission   12448  1   46 
           neutrons than is "seen" by the unscattered neutrons.   12448  1   47
