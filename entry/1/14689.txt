COMMENT    Compiler's comment: 1 eV is approximately equal 11600  14689  1   11 
           K or 1 K = 0.0862 meV. This ratio was used to convert  14689  1   12 
           temperatures into neutron energies. Therefore, 18 K    14689  1   13 
           neutron temperature is 1.5516 meV (0.0015516 eV).      14689  1   14

SAMPLE     Graphite, 12.96 g/cm2.                                 14689  2    4 
METHOD     (TOF) Neutrons of energy much lower than thermal were  14689  2    5 
           produced by filtering a beam of thermal neutrons       14689  2    6 
           through a block of graphite 23 cm long. In such a      14689  2    7 
           block, Bragg scattering removes the neutrons whose     14689  2    8 
           wave-length is less than the largest Bragg             14689  2    9 
           wave-length in graphite, 6.69 angstroms. Measurement   14689  2   10 
           of the boron absorption of the filtered neutrons       14689  2   11 
           showed that they had an effective wavelength of 7.15   14689  2   12 
           angstroms which corresponds to neutron temperatures    14689  2   13 
           around 18 Kelvin. The whole assembly was isolated      14689  2   14 
           from stray thermal neutrons by the cadmium shield. A   14689  2   15 
           cadmium plate could be inserted above the graphite     14689  2   16 
           filter in order to measure the background. In all      14689  2   17 
           measurements the small background observed with this   14689  2   18 
           cadmium plate in place was always subtracted.          14689  2   19 
           Measurements by the transmission method were made of   14689  2   20 
           the total cross sections of a number of substances     14689  2   21

SAMPLE     Graphite, 15.4 g/cm2.                                  14689 11    4 
METHOD     To show the effects of the thermal motion of the       14689 11    5 
           atoms in a crystal on the interference conditions,     14689 11    6 
           the scattering cross section for graphite was studied  14689 11    7 
           with filtered neutrons as a function of temperature    14689 11    8 
           of the scatterer. The scatterer was heated with an     14689 11    9 
           oxyacetylene torch and the temperature measured using  14689 11   10 
           a thermocouple. Temperature equilibrium was not        14689 11   11 
           perfectly established in these experiments but the     14689 11   12 
           effect is evident. These experiments show clearly      14689 11   13 
           that the thermal motion of the crystal atoms tends to  14689 11   14 
           destroy the interference conditions.                   14689 11   15
