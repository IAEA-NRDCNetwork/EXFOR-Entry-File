FACILITY   (REAC,1CANCRC) The NRX nuclear reactor at Chalk River. 14525  1    8 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The counter was the "end window" type with a   14525  1    9 
           mica window of mass 2.3 mgm./cm2.                      14525  1   10 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Spectroscopically pure samples of        14525  1   11 
           cerium oxide, sealed in small quartz ampoules, were    14525  1   12 
           irradiated in the NRX nuclear reactor at different     14525  1   13 
           neutron fluxes for different times. After irradiation, 14525  1   14 
           the cerium oxide was removed from the quartz ampoule   14525  1   15 
           and chemically separated. The final hydroxide          14525  1   16 
           precipitate was transferred as a slurry to an          14525  1   17 
           aluminum tray, where it was spread evenly, dried, and  14525  1   18 
           the counting-rate determined by a Geiger-Miiller       14525  1   19 
           counter. The pile neutron capture cross section of     14525  1   20 
           the 33 hr. Ce143 was determined by separating Pr144,   14525  1   21 
           the daughter of Ce144, from the rigorously-purified    14525  1   22 
           cerium at frequent intervals. The amount of Pr144      14525  1   23 
           formed increased linearly with the square of the       14525  1   24 
           neutron flux in a manner consistent with that of a     14525  1   25 
           successive neutron capture reaction.                   14525  1   26
