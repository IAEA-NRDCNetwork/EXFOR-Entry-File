SAMPLE     Evaporated adenine onto backing of aluminum or carbon  R002500200005 
           foils were used. The thicknesses of adenine were 1-2 mgR002500200006 
           per square cm. The thicknesses of aluminum backing wereR002500200007 
           1.4 to 7 mg per square cm. The backing was served as   R002500200008 
           catcher foil. The adenine surfaces were coated with a  R002500200009 
           polystyrene film of about 0.1 mg per square cm thick.  R002500200010
