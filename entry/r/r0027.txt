COMMENT    The aims of the work are to make labelled nitrate and  R002700100018 
           ammonia solutions of higher 13N activity, to           R002700100019 
           investigate their chemical and radiochemical purity,   R002700100020 
           and to prepare carrier-free solutions suitable for use R002700100021 
           in biological systems. The main results were as        R002700100022 
           follows. No unwanted isotopes were detected in 2.5-ml  R002700100023 
           carrier-free labelled ammonia solutions but 1 part in  R002700100024 
           1E+4 of the initial activity of the nitrate was 18F.   R002700100025 
           The labelled nitrate solutions contained 13N in nitrateR002700100026 
           , nitrite and cyanide ions (85%, 3%, and 1%,           R002700100027 
           respectively). Useable yields of 20 muCi oF 13N ammoniaR002700100028 
           and 57 muCi of 13N nitrate were obtained.              R002700100029
