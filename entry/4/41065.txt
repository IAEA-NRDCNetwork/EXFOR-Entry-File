SAMPLE      Po heat sources made in 1972-1973, containing at time 41065002    6 
           of manufacture (1.5 - 2.8)*10**8 MBq (4000-7600 Ci) of 41065002    7 
           Po-210.                                                41065002    8 
METHOD      Irradiation during 200 days. 209Po/210Po activity     41065002    9 
           ratio at the end of irradiation 1.3E-10.               41065002   10 
ANALYSIS   Reaction threshold was estimated to be close to 7.7MeV.41065002   11 
           Effective flux density was 1.E+11 n/cm2/sec for this   41065002   12 
           reaction may deviate by up to factor 10 from the value 41065002   13 
           assumed. So with adequate accuracy the cross section   41065002   14 
           for the formation of Po-209 in Po-210(n,2n) is in the  41065002   15 
           range 0.1 - 0.001 b.                                   41065002   16
