SAMPLE      Uranium-fluoride was placed on aluminum foil(natural  40081  1   12 
            uranium). Sample thickness was 0.1  mm and sample     40081  1   13 
            diameter was 19.0 mm. Uranium isotope composition was 40081  1   14 
            checked on alpha spectrometer. Uranium weight was     40081  1   15 
            about 10.0 milligrams  and was determined by alpha-   40081  1   16
