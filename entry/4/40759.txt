METHOD     (ASSOP) For absolute yield of neutrons.                40759001    8 
DETECTOR   (TELES)  Consists of three Cs-I(Tl) crystals of 80 mu, 40759001    9 
           100 mu, 1.8 mm thickness.                              40759001   10 
ANALYSIS    Channel width for energy analysis was 90 keV.         40759001   11 
CORRECTION Background was measured without sample - 5-10 % of     40759001   12 
           the total effect.                                      40759001   13 
           Background due to recoil protons in neutron scattering 40759001   14 
           from residual hydrogen in the sample was subtracted.   40759001   15 
           Number of random coincidences was negligible.          40759001   16
