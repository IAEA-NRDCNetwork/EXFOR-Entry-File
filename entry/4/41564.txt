INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons produced in the tungsten target (60mm 4156400100020 
           W) are collimated at zero angle at a length of 12 m in 4156400100021 
           order to form a beam with a diameter of about 60 mm at 4156400100022 
           the reaction CD2 target.                               4156400100023 
INC-SPECT   Neutrons incident on the deuterium target have a      4156400100024 
           continuous energy spectrum, with an endpoint energy    4156400100025 
           equal to the proton beam energy. Detection of three    4156400100026 
           particles in coincidence makes it possible to          4156400100027 
           reconstruct the primary neutron energy in the          4156400100028 
           n+d -> p+n+n reaction and obtain data on the reaction  4156400100029 
           yield in a wide range of neutron energies, determined  4156400100030 
           only by the statistics of the experiment.              4156400100031

           The neutron time-of-flight hodoscope consists of       4156400100034 
           several (5-6 at the moment) detectors, located at      4156400100035 
           different angles with respect to the primary neutron   4156400100036 
           direction at a flight distance of 4-5 m from the CD2   4156400100037

           The time resolution of all detectors was about 0.6 ns. 4156400100039 
           The angular resolution was defined by the detector     4156400100040 
           cross section size and the time-of-flight distance;    4156400100041 
           it was about +-0.5deg.                                 4156400100042
