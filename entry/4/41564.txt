INC-SOURCE (SPALL) Neutrons produced in the tungsten target (60mm 41564001   24 
           W) are collimated at zero angle at a length of 12 m in 41564001   25 
           order to form a beam with a diameter of about 60 mm at 41564001   26 
           the reaction CD2 target.                               41564001   27 
INC-SPECT   Neutrons incident on the deuterium target have a      41564001   28 
           continuous energy spectrum, with an endpoint energy    41564001   29 
           equal to the proton beam energy. Detection of three    41564001   30 
           particles in coincidence makes it possible to          41564001   31 
           reconstruct the primary neutron energy in the          41564001   32 
           n+d -> p+n+n reaction and obtain data on the reaction  41564001   33 
           yield in a wide range of neutron energies, determined  41564001   34 
           only by the statistics of the experiment.              41564001   35

           The neutron time-of-flight hodoscope consists of       41564001   38 
           several (5-6 at the moment) detectors, located at      41564001   39 
           different angles with respect to the primary neutron   41564001   40 
           direction at a flight distance of 4-5 m from the CD2   41564001   41

           The time resolution of all detectors was about 0.6 ns. 41564001   43 
           The angular resolution was defined by the detector     41564001   44 
           cross section size and the time-of-flight distance;    41564001   45 
           it was about +-0.5deg.                                 41564001   46
