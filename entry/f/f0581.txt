SAMPLE     The target assembly of pure tantalum foils was used.   F0581  1   11 
           The thickness of assembly used on U-120 was of such    F0581  1   12 
           value, that the energies of alpha particles were       F0581  1   13 
           decreased down to 0 MeV. The thicknesses of foils used F0581  1   14 
           on U-240 were equal to 80 and 200 microns. The energiesF0581  1   15 
           of alpha particles were decreased from 100 MeV down to F0581  1   16 
           30 MeV.                                                F0581  1   17
