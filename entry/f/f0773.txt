DETECTOR   (TELES,SI)Telescope consisted of six silicon detectors F077300100013 
           for E(alpha)=75,90 and 115 MeV, and of five silicon    F077300100014 
           detectors for E(alpha)=30 and 50 MeV. Detector assemblyF077300100015 
           was placed at the distance of 60 cm from scattering    F077300100016 
           target and at the angle of 20 degrees to beam axis     F077300100017 
           inside of a big scattering chamber. The thicknesses of F077300100018 
           dE - detectors were from 50 to 380 mu-m.               F077300100019 
           Aluminum diaphragm of 5 mm thickness and inner diameterF077300100020 
           of 10 mm limited the angle spread of scattered         F077300100021 
           particles to 1 degr. Energy spread of scattered 4He    F077300100022 
           ions was about 400 keV at different beam energies.     F077300100023 
METHOD     (TRN) Method of attenuation of alpha particle beam     F077300100024 
           was used.                                              F077300100025 
           (EDE) Particle determination was performed using the   F077300100026 
           results of the energy losses in delta E counters.      F077300100027 
SAMPLE     208Pb with the thickness of 4mg/cm2 was used to scatterF077300100028 
           the He-4 ions. One of the silicon detectors was used   F077300100029 
           as a target.                                           F077300100030 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)Errors indicated include statistical errors  F077300100031

           (EN-ERR)Errors are determined by the energy loss in    F077300100034 
           detectors and by the widths of energy distributions.   F077300100035
