INC-SPECT  Energy spread was 10 keV.                              F050600100009 
SAMPLE     Mo metallic, self-supporting targets with a high degreeF050600100010 
           of homogeneity were employed.                          F050600100011 
DETECTOR   (SOLST) 2 silicon semiconductor detectors mounted on a F050600100012 
           coolable turntable were used in the angular range      F050600100013 
           between 7.5 and 168 degrees in steps of 2.5 to 5       F050600100014 
           degrees.                                               F050600100015 
MONITOR    Target thicknesses were determined by weighing and by  F050600100016 
           measurement of the energy loss of alpha-particles.     F050600100017 
           Monitor detectors were used at +-25 degrees.           F050600100018 
           Absolute energy calibration was carried out using the  F050600100019 
           peak positions of the well-known quadrupole and        F050600100020 
           octupole one-phonon states and the ground state.       F050600100021 
ERR-ANALYS Absolute integrated cross sections for the elastic     F050600100022 
           scattering were fixed to about +-1%.                   F050600100023
