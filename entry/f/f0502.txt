           6*4 Si detectors (22 mm*45 mm*0.1 mm).The detectors    F0502  1   17 
           were mounted in cylindrical geometry (internal diameterF0502  1   18

           particles with high efficiency (11.5% and 25%,         F0502  1   30

           The calibration of the silicon detectors was performed F0502  1   36
