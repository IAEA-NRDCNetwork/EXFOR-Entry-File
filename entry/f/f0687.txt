DETECTOR   (GELI) 1. Ge(Li)- spectrometer with a crystal size of  F0687  1    9 
           100 cm*3 and the energy resolution of 3.8 keV for      F0687  1   10 
           Eg=661 keV was used for check measurements.            F0687  1   11 
           2. Ge(Li)- spectrometer with a crystal size of 80 cm*3 F0687  1   12 
           and the energy resolution of 2.8 keV for Eg=1.332 MeV  F0687  1   13 
           was used for the final series of measurements.         F0687  1   14 
SAMPLE     (48-CD-114,ENR=0.99) The targets were self-supporting  F0687  1   15 
           foils of Cd  (3.3 and 5.9 mg/cm2 thickness)with 99%    F0687  1   16 
           enrichment of 114Cd.                                   F0687  1   17 
           As a monitor target a copper foil with the natural     F0687  1   18 
           isotope composition (4.05 and 4.18 mu-g/cm2 thickness) F0687  1   19 
           located at the place of main target was used.          F0687  1   20 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were defined by induced         F0687  1   21 
           activity method. 1. The check measurements allowed to  F0687  1   22 
           establish the presence of the gamma-lines under study  F0687  1   23 
            (190, 558, and 725 keV) in the 114In decay spectrum   F0687  1   24 
           and to estimate their relative intensity.              F0687  1   25 
            2. Final measurements were carried out 48 h after the F0687  1   26 
           exposure (run 1) and 42 days after the exposure (run 2)F0687  1   27 
           They were helped to solve problems arising from        F0687  1   28 
           short-lived isotopes 113In, 115In, and 116In           F0687  1   29 
           and annihilation peaks.                                F0687  1   30
