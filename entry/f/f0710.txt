INC-SPECT  Current of the bunched triton beam was held below 4 nA.F071000100009 
SAMPLE     Water target was solid (ice) in a thin-walled stainlessF071000100010 
           steel cup with one face in direct contact with the     F071000100011 
           accelerator vacuum. Cooling the target from the        F071000100012 
           outside by direct contact with liquid nitrogen in a    F071000100013 
           small cryostat of styrofoam maintained the solid phase F071000100014 
           of the water.                                          F071000100015 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 2x2 in. liquid scintillator (NE213) was used.   F071000100016 
METHOD     (TOF) Two pulse-height biases were used simultaneously F071000100017 
            (Compton edge of Cs-137 and of Na-22). The flight pathF071000100018 
           was 3.53 m, the total time resolution was 2.1 ns.      F071000100019 
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were derived from the high-energy       F071000100020 
           portions of the yield curves.                          F071000100021 
MONITOR    (1-H-1(T,N)2-HE-3,,DA) By comparing the measured yield F071000100022 
           from this reaction with the calculated yield the       F071000100023 
           experimental setup was calibrated. Standard gas targetsF071000100024 
           were used.                                             F071000100025 
           Energy dependence of the efficiency of the neutron     F071000100026 
           detector was determined by measuring neutron yields of F071000100027 
           the reactions H-2(t,n)He-4 and H-1(t,n)He-3 at about 30F071000100028 
           energy points between 2.2 and 36.9 MeV and comparing   F071000100029 
           them with well-known cross sections.                   F071000100030 
CORRECTION The attenuation correction due to nonelastic processed F071000100031 
           is quite small and introduces negligible errors.       F071000100032 
           However, multiple scattering in the target and its     F071000100033 
           structure which was not corrected for is estimated to  F071000100034 
           affect the data by as much as 4%.                      F071000100035 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)   Errors given in a table are from counting    F071000100036 
           statistics only.                                       F071000100037 
           Common scale error is composed of 3.5% calibration     F071000100038 
           error, the current integrator calibration error (<0.5%)F071000100039 
           and the systematic portion of the attenuation error    F071000100040 
            (<0.5%), adding up to about 4%.                       F071000100041 
           Uncertainty of the specific energy loss of the tritons F071000100042 
           in water contributes to the common scale error.        F071000100043 
           Uncertainty of the zero-degree position was +-0.2      F071000100044 
           degree.                                                F071000100045 
           Uncertainties in the integrated charge and in the dead F071000100046 
           time were each < 0.5%.                                 F071000100047
