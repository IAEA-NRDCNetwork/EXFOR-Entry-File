INC-SOURCE On its way to the collimators an unpolarized proton    F0989  1   12 
           beam is deflected in an auxiliary magnetic field by an F0989  1   13 
           angle of 14.2 degr. Thus the beam was purified of      F0989  1   14 
           neutral and low energy particle admixture.             F0989  1   15 
           Geometrically, the collimation was such that at the    F0989  1   16 
           place of the scatterer the following conditions were   F0989  1   17 
           fulfilled: a) the beam image on the autograph was 20 mmF0989  1   18 
           high and 10 mm wide and b) the horizontal plane beam   F0989  1   19 
           divergence was equal to +-0.15 degr. Due care was takenF0989  1   20 
           to reduce the proton scattering effect in the          F0989  1   21 
           collimator walls.                                      F0989  1   22 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,CEREN) The scattered protons were          F0989  1   23 
           registered by a telescope of 3 scintillation counters  F0989  1   24 
           and one Cerenkov counter with a plexiglass radiator.   F0989  1   25 
MONITOR    The averaged results of the measurements of the        F0989  1   26 
           counting rate were used to plot the angular            F0989  1   27 
           distribution of charged secondaries. The corresponding F0989  1   28 
           curve   was  then  normalized to  values of the        F0989  1   29 
           differential cross sections for the emission of        F0989  1   30 
           charged secondaries in p+C collisions, which were      F0989  1   31 
           obtained earlier in L.Azhgirey,J,JETP,36,1631,1959,    F0989  1   32 
           under conditions identical with those of the present   F0989  1   33 
           experiments. The total energy spectrum of charged      F0989  1   34 
           secondaries, measured at 7 degr., was also normalized  F0989  1   35 
           to a value of the differential cross section for       F0989  1   36 
           the same angles and equal to 1.1+-0.055 b/sr.          F0989  1   37
