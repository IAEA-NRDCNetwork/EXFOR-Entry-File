SAMPLE     LiF of natural isotopic content. Targets consisting of F0060  1    8 
            0.025 mg/cm2 LiF, evaporated on to thin carbon foils, F0060  1    9

ANALYSIS   This experiment was secondary to that of 19F(d,p)20F   F0060  1   11 
            (see REL-REF). Two methods have been used to estimate F0060  1   12 
           the absolute differential cross sections for the       F0060  1   13 
           lithium groups, since the absolute beam-charge incidentF0060  1   14 
           on the target could not be reliably measured.          F0060  1   15 
            1. Results obtained by Ono et al. (see MONIT-REF) wereF0060  1   16 
           used to determine  the constant of proportionality (K) F0060  1   17 
           taking into account that the angular distributions     F0060  1   18 
           obtained by these authors and present results are      F0060  1   19 
           closely similar.                                       F0060  1   20 
            2. The second method for obtaining K uses the measuredF0060  1   21 
           absolute cross section of the 12C(d,p0)12C reaction    F0060  1   22 
            (see REL-REF) and the ratio of the number of 6Li to   F0060  1   23 
           12C atoms in the target.                               F0060  1   24
