SAMPLE     For the 2- to 8-MeV deuteron energy range pieces of    F014200100007 
           1.4-mil rolled beryllium foil were used as a target.   F014200100008 
           This foil was sandwiched between five 4-mil            F014200100009 
           thicknesses of aluminum backing and another of aluminumF014200100010 
           foils which was used to slow the beam to the desired   F014200100011 
           energy. This sandwich was then covered by a 'hut' of   F014200100012 
           three 4-mil thicknesses of aluminum foil.              F014200100013 
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACHI) The 37-inch 8-Mev cyclotron and        F014200100014 
           (CCW,1USACHI) the 400-kev Cockroft-Walton accelerator  F014200100015 
           supplied the deuterons.                                F014200100016 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Self-quenching G-M counters containing argon,  F014200100017 
           alcohol, and up to two centimeters of hydrogen have    F014200100018 
           been used.                                             F014200100019 
METHOD     After a bombardment was completed, the beryllium and   F014200100020 
           all the aluminum foils were placed in a alumina cup in F014200100021 
           porcelain furnace tube in a hydrogen atmosphere. This  F014200100022 
           tube was heated for thirty minutes to 950 to 1000      F014200100023 
           degr. After cooling to about 350 degr., the hydrogen,  F014200100024 
           now containing the tritium, was pumped into a counter  F014200100025 
           already containing 1.8 cm ethylene and 6 cm argon and  F014200100026 
           was counted.                                           F014200100027
