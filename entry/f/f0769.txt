DETECTOR   (TELES,SI)Silicon detector of sandwich type was used.  F0769  1   14 
           The working area of the detector was ~ 3 cm2 and the   F0769  1   15 
           total length of the telescope was 10 cm. Telescope     F0769  1   16 
           detectors had different thicknesses from 400-1200 mu-m F0769  1   17 
           measured with the accuracy of 3 mu-m.                  F0769  1   18 
SAMPLE     Thick beryllium target (140 mg/cm2) was used to obtain F0769  1   19 
           the secondary beam of He-6 ions for silicon irradiationF0769  1   20 
           Telescope detectors served as a target; they detected  F0769  1   21 
           reaction products and reduced the energy of 6He ions.  F0769  1   22
