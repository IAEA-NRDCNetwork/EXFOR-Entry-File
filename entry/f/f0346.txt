ANALYSIS   The cross-section for the reaction was calculated      F0346  3    4 
           from the observed excitation function and estimated    F0346  3    5 
           target thickness, with the assumption of an isotropic  F0346  3    6 
           angular distribution of the emitted alpha particles.   F0346  3    7 
           At a bombarding energy of 530 keV, at which the alpha  F0346  3    8 
           particles are well resolved from the scattered         F0346  3    9 
           protons, the thin target yield for a solid angle of    F0346  3   10 
           4Pi is                                                 F0346  3   11 
                 Y(E)=4.3 x 10**(-8) alpha particles per proton.  F0346  3   12 
           In calculating the cross- section for the reaction     F0346  3   13 
           from this yield, allowance must be made for the        F0346  3   14 
           formation of He+ ions (which would not have been       F0346  3   15 
           detected) as the alpha particles leave the target.     F0346  3   16 
           From the work of Briggs (1927) it is estimated that    F0346  3   17 
           the ratio of He+ to He++ ions under the conditions of  F0346  3   18 
           the experiment was 0.5 and the cross-section is        F0346  3   19 
           therefore                                              F0346  3   20 
               sig(E)= 1.5 x Y(E)/N = 1.2 x 10**(-26) cm2,        F0346  3   21 
                                                for Ep=530 keV    F0346  3   22 
           where N, the number of 10B nuclei/cm2 of the target,   F0346  3   23 
           has been taken to be 5.4 x 10**(-18).                  F0346  3   24
