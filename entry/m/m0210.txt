COMMENT    THE SZILARD-CHALMERS REACTION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A  M021000100012 
            SENSITIVE DETECTOR FOR THE COMPARISON OF NEUTRONS FROMM021000100013 
            SOURCES OF DIFFERENT PRIMARY ENERGY AND ANGULAR       M021000100014 
            DISTRIBUTION. USING SODIUM PERMANGANATE SOLUTION,     M021000100015 
            A DETECTION EFFICIENCY OF APPROXIMATELY 7% FOR        M021000100016 
            ALL NEUTRONS IN THE ENERGY RANGE 0-5 MEV WAS OBTAINED M021000100017 
            AND HIGH ACCURACY ACHIEVED.                           M021000100018 
           THE METHOD OF DETECTION WAS EMPLOYED TO MAKE THE       M021000100019 
            FOLLOWING MEASUREMENTS:                               M021000100020 
            (I) THE NEUTRON YIELD FROM THE SPONTANEOUS FISSION OF M021000100021 
             NATURAL URANIUM WAS FOUND TO BE                      M021000100022 
             1.56(0.12)*10**(-2)*N*SEC**(-1)**(-1).               M021000100023 
            (II) THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION LI-6(GAMMA,N) M021000100024 
             AT 6.2 MEV WASFOUND TO BE (3.+-2.)*10**-28 CM**2.    M021000100025 
            (III) THE CROSS SECTION FOR THE REACTION BE9(N,2N)    M021000100026 
             INDUCED BY RA-BE AND RA-BE SOURCES OF NEUTRONS WAS   M021000100027 
             FOUND TO BE 0.37(0.06)*10**-24 CM**2.                M021000100028 
            (IV) A LIMIT WAS PLACED ONTHE CROSS-OVER TRANSITION   M021000100029 
             FROM THE 2.5 MEV STATE TO THEGROUND STATE IN CO60.   M021000100030 
             THE TRANSITION PROBABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE < 1.10**-6M021000100031
