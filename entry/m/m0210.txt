COMMENT    The Szilard-Chalmers reaction has been developed as a  M0210  1   12 
            sensitive detector for the  comparison  of  neutrons  M0210  1   13 
            from sources of different primary energy and angular  M0210  1   14 
            distribution.  Using sodium permanganate solution, a  M0210  1   15 
            detection  efficiency  of  approximately 7%  for all  M0210  1   16 
            neutrons in the energy range 0 - 5 MeV was  obtained  M0210  1   17 
            and high accuracy achieved.                           M0210  1   18 
           The method of detection  was  employed  to  make  the  M0210  1   19 
            following  measurements:  (I) the neutron yield from  M0210  1   20 
            the spontaneous fission of natural uranium was found  M0210  1   21 
              to be                                               M0210  1   22 
             1.56(0.12)*10**(-2)*n*sec**(-1)**(-1).               M0210  1   23 
            (ii) the cross section for the reaction Li-6(gamma,n) M0210  1   24 
             at 6.2 MeV was found to be (3.+-2.)*10**-28 cm**2.   M0210  1   25 
            (iii) the cross section for the reaction Be-9(n,2n)   M0210  1   26 
             induced by Ra-Be and Ra-Be sources of neutrons was   M0210  1   27 
             found to be 0.37(0.06)*10**-24 cm**2.                M0210  1   28 
            (iv) a limit was placed onthe cross-over transition   M0210  1   29 
             from the 2.5 MeV state to theground state in Co-60.  M0210  1   30 
             The transition  probability  was  found  to  be   <  M0210  1   31 
             1.10**-6  of that for the cascade consisting of the  M0210  1   32 
             two gamma rays.                                      M0210  1   33
