SAMPLE     The target chamber was constracted of brass, with      M046900100009 
           thin alumiseal (a mylar-aluminium laminate) windows.   M046900100010 
           The target chamber was filled with 3He gas at          M046900100011 
           slightly less than atmospheric pressure, so that       M046900100012 
           the chamber was a constant-volume device of 0.5        M046900100013

ANALYSIS   Coincidencies were demanded between the proton and     M046900100019 
           deuteron from the two-body 3He disintegration. The     M046900100020 
           particle energies were determined by pulse-height      M046900100021 
           measurement, and electrons were rejected by pulse-     M046900100022 
           shape analysis. The yield was obtained from the        M046900100023 
           corrected numbers of p-d coincidencies and then was    M046900100024 
           used for obtaining the differential cross section      M046900100025 
           for two-body 3He disintegration. The three-body        M046900100026 
           3He disintegration cross section was obtained with     M046900100027 
           the aid of p-p events.                                 M046900100028 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical and total errors are presented. M046900100029

            5%.                                                   M046900100031 
COMMENT    The 90-degrees photodisintegration cross sections for  M046900100032 
           3He were measured for incident photon energies         M046900100033 
           between 8.5 and 21.5 MeV by detecting proton-deuteron  M046900100034 
           coincidencies in CsI(Tl) scintillators immersed in     M046900100035 
           1 atm gas. The source of gamma-quanta was the          M046900100036 
           Bremsstrahlung beam of the University of Illinois      M046900100037 
           22 MeV betatron. The particle energies were            M046900100038 
           determined by pulse-height measurement, and electrons  M046900100039 
           were rejected by pulse-shape analysis.                 M046900100040
