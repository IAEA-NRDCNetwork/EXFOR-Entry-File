SAMPLE     The target was a  vertical  mylar  cylinder  (4.0  cm  M0481  1   16 
            diameter,  10  cm  high,  wall  thickness  0.08 mm),  M0481  1   17 
            filled with liquid deuterium.                         M0481  1   18

ANALYSIS   Proton spectra were simultaneously recorded at 5  lab  M0481  1   20 
            angles  from 32.5 to 130 degrees with respect to the  M0481  1   21 
            photon beam and at 7  annihilation  photon  energies  M0481  1   22 
            from 100 to 260 MeV.  The proton energies also being  M0481  1   23 
            measured,    The    reaction    is     kinematically  M0481  1   24 
            overdetermined.  The photon energy spectra were also  M0481  1   25 
            measured by pair spectrometer. Only the peaks in the  M0481  1   26 
            proton and phoron spectra were used to determine the  M0481  1   27 
            cross section. Moreover, by use this program, it was  M0481  1   28 
            also possible to determine the cross section also in  M0481  1   29 
            the bremsstrahlung tail region.                       M0481  1   30

           (ERR-SYS) Systematic  errors are only estimated to be  M0481  1   32 
            about 5%.                                             M0481  1   33 
COMMENT    Differential cross   sections   for   the    reaction  M0481  1   34 
            H-2(g,p)n  were  measured  at five laboratory angles  M0481  1   35 
            from 32 to 130 degrees, for photon energies from 100  M0481  1   36 
            to  220  MeV.  A  quasimonochromatic photon beam was  M0481  1   37 
            used and the photon spectrum was measured on line by  M0481  1   38 
            a  pair  spectrometer.  The energy resolution may be  M0481  1   39 
            estimated as be about 10%  using the published  data  M0481  1   40 
            on  on-line  measurement  of  photon  spectrum.  The  M0481  1   41 
            absolute normalization uncertainty is within 5%.      M0481  1   42
