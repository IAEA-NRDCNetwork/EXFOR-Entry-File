SAMPLE     The depleted u-238 foil of 3.2 mm thickness            M042600100013 
            (4.3 mg/cm**2).                                       M042600100014 
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,DIFFR) The  cross section was derived from the  M042600100015 
            experimental  yield  curve   as   the   approximated  M042600100016 
            solution by the photon difference method.             M042600100017 
CORRECTION Correction for spontaneous fission rate of the sample  M042600100018 
            was  done  simply by measuring the time during which  M042600100019 
            the  mica  was  in  contact  with  the  sample,  and  M042600100020 
            calculating  the  track-density  correction from the  M042600100021 
            known spontaneous fission half-life.                  M042600100022 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The  errors  are the quadratic sums of the  M042600100023 
            standard deviations resulting from  track  countings  M042600100024 
            and  an  estimated  (near  20%)  uncertainty  in the  M042600100025 
            bremsstrahlung spectrum.                              M042600100026 
COMMENT    The photofission  cross section of U-238 was measured  M042600100027 
            in the 2.75 to 5.75  MeV  range.  Cross  section  as  M042600100028 
            small as 2 * 10**(-11) barns were detected.  A shelf  M042600100029 
            was observed which had been predicted  to  occur  in  M042600100030 
            the   cross   section  owing  to  the  dominance  of  M042600100031 
            radiative decay of levels in the second well of  the  M042600100032 
            potential barrier of U-238.                           M042600100033
