SAMPLE     The target was a conventional 7 liter, liquid helium   M048500100011 
           dewar. While runnung, the dewar was pressured to       M048500100012

ANALYSIS   (INTAD) With reasonably high statistical accuracy      M048500100016 
           the reaction cross section simultaneously have been    M048500100017 
           measured at five laboratory angles between 30 and      M048500100018 
           142 degrees. Differential cross sections were          M048500100019 
           obtained by comparing the He-4(g,n)He-3 and            M048500100020 
           H-2(g,n)H-1 cross sections. The latter were obtained   M048500100021 
           from alternating runs with D(2)O and H(2)O in an       M048500100022 
           identical target configuration as that used for        M048500100023 
           helium. for the deuterium cross section, the           M048500100024 
           experimental results were normalized to the            M048500100025 
           calculation of partovi. Differential cross sections    M048500100026 
           were used to obtain the total cross section.           M048500100027

CORRECTION The photoneutron energy spectra were first             M048500100034 
           corrected for counting losses (< 2%), and              M048500100035 
           background was substracted. corrections for neutron    M048500100036 
           scattering and absorption within the target were       M048500100037 
           made with a monte-carlo method. the contribution       M048500100038 
           of neutrons from other competing channels was          M048500100039 
           assessed by comparing data taken at lower incident     M048500100040 
           electron energies. the other neutron producing         M048500100041 
           channels, contributing < 10% to the spectra, were      M048500100042 
           substracted where necessary from the data.             M048500100043 
COMMENT    The He-4(g,n)He-3 differential cross section has       M048500100044 
           been simultaneously measured at five laboratory        M048500100045 
           angles between 30 and 142 defrees, from threshold      M048500100046 
           to 110 MeV. The asymmetry in the angular distribution  M048500100047 
           from 24 to 70 MeV has been extracted and found to      M048500100048 
           have sign changes at energies which are in accord      M048500100049 
           with the previous experiments. The total photo-        M048500100050 
           neutron cross section has been observed to be close    M048500100051 
           to the known (g,p) cross section. fFom the energy      M048500100052 
           dependence of the asymmetry coefficient a 2+ state     M048500100053 
           in He-4 at energy of about 35 MeV has been confirmed.  M048500100054
