SAMPLE     The target was a conventional 7 liter, liquid helium   M0485  1   11 
            dewar. While runnung, the dewar was pressured to      M0485  1   12 
            0.034 atm to minimize the loss rate and reduce        M0485  1   13

ANALYSIS   (INTAD) With reasonably high statistical accuracy      M0485  1   16 
            the reaction cross section simultaneously have been   M0485  1   17 
            measured at five laboratory angles between 30 and     M0485  1   18 
            142 degrees. Differential cross sections were         M0485  1   19 
            obtained by comparing the He-4(g,n)He-3 and           M0485  1   20 
            H-2(g,n)H-1 cross sections. The latter were obtained  M0485  1   21 
            from alternating runs with D(2)O and H(2)O in an      M0485  1   22 
            identical target configuration as that used for       M0485  1   23 
            helium. for the deuterium cross section, the          M0485  1   24 
            experimental results were normalized to the           M0485  1   25 
            calculation of Partovi. Differential cross sections   M0485  1   26 
            were used to obtain the total cross section.          M0485  1   27

CORRECTION The photoneutron energy spectra were first             M0485  1   34 
            corrected for counting losses (< 2%), and             M0485  1   35 
            background was substracted. corrections for neutron   M0485  1   36 
            scattering and absorption within the target were      M0485  1   37 
            made with a monte-carlo method. the contribution      M0485  1   38 
            of neutrons from other competing channels was         M0485  1   39 
            assessed by comparing data taken at lower incident    M0485  1   40 
            electron energies. the other neutron producing        M0485  1   41 
            channels, contributing < 10% to the spectra, were     M0485  1   42 
            substracted where necessary from the data.            M0485  1   43 
COMMENT    The He-4(g,n)He-3 differential cross section has       M0485  1   44 
            been simultaneously measured at five laboratory       M0485  1   45 
            angles between 30 and 142 degrees, from threshold     M0485  1   46 
            to 110 MeV. The asymmetry in the angular distribution M0485  1   47 
            from 24 to 70 MeV has been extracted and found to     M0485  1   48 
            have sign changes at energies which are in accord     M0485  1   49 
            with the previous experiments. The total photo-       M0485  1   50 
            neutron cross section has been observed to be close   M0485  1   51 
            to the known (g,p) cross section. From the energy     M0485  1   52 
            dependence of the asymmetry coefficient a 2+ state    M0485  1   53 
            in He-4 at energy of about 35 MeV has been confirmed. M0485  1   54
