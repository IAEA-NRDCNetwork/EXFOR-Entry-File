            After the etching  of  the  MAKROFOL  detector,  the  M0402  1   20 
            identification and counting of fission fragments was  M0402  1   21 
            realized by three observers for each detector, using  M0402  1   22 
            optical microscopes. Finally-taking into account the  M0402  1   23 
            factors of identification efficiency,  geometry  and  M0402  1   24 
            track    counting,    as    well   as   effects   of  M0402  1   25 
            self-absorption   by    target-photofossion    cross  M0402  1   26 
            sections were obtained.                               M0402  1   27

COMMENT    Experimental results on fission cross section and the  M0402  1   29 
            fissionability of the Au-197,  Pb-nat, and Bi-209 at  M0402  1   30 
            photon  energies  60  and 64 MeV are presented.  The  M0402  1   31 
            experimental photofission cross sections  were  used  M0402  1   32 
            to  evaluate the total nuclear photoabsorption cross  M0402  1   33 
            sections: sig(g,abs)=0.089*a**0.97 mb at en = 60 MeV  M0402  1   34 
            and  sig(g,abs)  = 0.060*a**1.042 mb at en = 64 MeV.  M0402  1   35 
            The photon beam was  obtained  by  backward  Compton  M0402  1   36 
            scattering   of   laser   light   on  the  electrons  M0402  1   37 
            circulating in ADONE storage ring. The main features  M0402  1   38 
            of  this  beam  are a satisfactory energy resolution  M0402  1   39 
            (up to 10%  fwhm,  at maximum energy),  an extremely  M0402  1   40 
            low  background  (about  5%  integrated  over  whole  M0402  1   41 
            spectrum above 2 MeV),  an intensity of about  10**5  M0402  1   42 
            g/s and almost complete linear polarization.          M0402  1   43
