CORRECTION The number  of  photoneutrons in each energy interval  M0303  1   14 
            was  obtained  by  taking  into  account:             M0303  1   15 
            1) the  probability  of  producing acceptable recoil  M0303  1   16 
            protons in the volume of  emulsion  examined,  which  M0303  1   17 
            included  (A) the number of hydrogen nuclei per unit  M0303  1   18 
            of volume of nuclear emulsion,  (B)  the  amount  of  M0303  1   19 
            neutron   path   length   in  the  volume,  (C)  the  M0303  1   20 
            neutron-proton scattering  cross  section,  (D)  the  M0303  1   21 
            fraction of recoil lying within acceptable angles;    M0303  1   22 
            2) the absorption of  neutrons  by  the  target  and  M0303  1   23 
            along their paths through the plates.                 M0303  1   24

           (TRCS) A  yield curve for the photoneutrons from lead  M0303  1   28 
            was obtained using neutron counters in paraffin  and  M0303  1   29 
            was normalized at 23 MeV to the yield observed using  M0303  1   30 
            nuclear emulsion.  The cross section curve for  lead  M0303  1   31 
            was  derived  from  the yield curve and X-ray energy  M0303  1   32 
            spectrum by means of the photon difference method.    M0303  1   33

ANALYSIS   The energy  distribution  of  the  photoneutrons  was  M0303  2    4 
            obtained  by (1) summing the neutrons in each energy  M0303  2    5 
            interval over the angles 30,  50,  70,  90, 110, 130  M0303  2    6 
            and  150  degrees,  (2) dividing the neutron sums by  M0303  2    7 
            the sum of the fractional solid angles, (3) dividing  M0303  2    8 
            by  the  number of moles of target irradiated by the  M0303  2    9 
            beam and (4) dividing by the exposure in  roentgens,  M0303  2   10 
            corrected  for the effective absorption of x-rays by  M0303  2   11 
            the target.                                           M0303  2   12
