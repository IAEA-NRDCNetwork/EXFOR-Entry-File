SAMPLE     The liquid  He-3  target  has   been contained in the  M0471  1   11 
            He-4 cryostat dewar. The 30 liter of He-3 gas in the  M0471  1   12 
            storage  tank were the slowly pumped into the target  M0471  1   13 
            space where condensation of He-3 liquid was visually  M0471  1   14 
            observed  at  a pressure of about 525 torr.  Typical  M0471  1   15 
            operating pressures and temperatures  for  the  He-4  M0471  1   16 
            bath  space  and He-3 target space were 110 torr and  M0471  1   17 
            2.69  degrees  K,  450  torr  and  2.70  degrees  K,  M0471  1   18 
            respectively.                                         M0471  1   19 
DETECTOR   (BF3) The neutron detection  system  was  a  modified  M0471  1   20 
            'Halpern-type  detector'  consisting of BF3 counters  M0471  1   21 
            immersed  in   a   mineral-oil   moderator.   Eleven  M0471  1   22 
            counters,  each  having a diameter of 2 inchs and an  M0471  1   23 
            active length of 15.7 inches,  were placed  parallel  M0471  1   24 
            and around the central 6.75 inches beam tube.         M0471  1   25 
COMMENT    The He-3(g,n)2p cross section has been measured in  1  M0471  1   26 
            MeV  steps  from  threshold  to  30  MeV  using  the  M0471  1   27 
            national bureau of standards  betatron  and  a  He-4  M0471  1   28 
            cryostat  to produce a 40-cm***3 liquid He-3 target.  M0471  1   29 
            The  measured  cross  section  shows  a  broad  peak  M0471  1   30 
            between  14  and 20 MeV with a maximum cross section  M0471  1   31 
            at about  0.90  mb.  The  integrated  cross  section  M0471  1   32 
            values were obtained also.                            M0471  1   33
