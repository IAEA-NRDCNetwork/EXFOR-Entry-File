COMMENT    The weighted-average reaction cross sections were      M1019  1   26 
            obtained using weight-average fluxes of               M1019  1   27 
            bremsstrahlung gamma-rays since those are             M1019  1   28 
            continuously distributed from the boundary energy     M1019  1   29 
            EN-MAX and therefore only integrated cross sections   M1019  1   30 
            are in fact measured in experiments.                  M1019  1   31
