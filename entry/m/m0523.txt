COMMENT    The (g,p) and (g,n) differential yields  at  90 degree M0523  1   33 
            have been measured for  two-body  photodisintegration M0523  1   34 
            of He-4  using  tagged photons of energy Eg = 25 - 60 M0523  1   35 
            MeV. Data   for   both   channels    were    obtained M0523  1   36 
            simultaneously using  windowless  ede  telescopes  to M0523  1   37 
            detect the  H-3  and  He-3  recoils.  The  ratio   of M0523  1   38 
            angle-integrated yields   which   is  insensitive  to M0523  1   39 
            systematic uncertainties due to the  simultaneity  of M0523  1   40 
            the measurements,  agrees with calculations employing M0523  1   41 
            only charge-symmetric  nuclear  interactions.  Within M0523  1   42 
            the present  errors  the  data  show no evidence of a M0523  1   43 
            significant charge-symmetry  violation  in  He-4   in M0523  1   44 
            energy range studied.                                 M0523  1   45
