SAMPLE     Beryllium target,  whose shape is a hollow cylinder 6  M0438  1   22 
            cm  in outer diameter by 6 cm high,  with walls of 1  M0438  1   23

DETECTOR   (BF3) Four BF3 counters embedded in paraffin.          M0438  1   26 
ANALYSIS   The cross  section  values  were  obtained  using the  M0438  1   27 
            equation: sig(Eg)=k*c(s)/i(s)*delta(Eg)*epsilon(En),  M0438  1   28 
            where  'k' is a constant which depends only upon the  M0438  1   29 
            shape of the be target,  'c(s)' is the counting rate  M0438  1   30 
            of  neutrons  due  to  the source 's' with intensity  M0438  1   31 
            'i(s)',  energy 'Eg', and emission rate 'delta', and  M0438  1   32 
            'epsilon(En)'  is  the  efficiency  of  the  neutron  M0438  1   33 
            detector for neutrons with energy 'En'.               M0438  1   34

COMMENT    Six kinds of radioisotopes were used to measure cross  M0438  1   36 
            section   of   the   Be-9(g,n)   reaction  near  its  M0438  1   37 
            threshold.  Because all other possible  photonuclear  M0438  1   38 
            reactions  have  a  larger thresholds this is a pure  M0438  1   39 
            reaction Be-9(g,n).                                   M0438  1   40
