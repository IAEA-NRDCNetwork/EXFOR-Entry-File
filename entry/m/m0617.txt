COMMENT    Angular distributions   of   tritons  emitted  in  the M0617  1   41 
            reaction 7Li(g,t)a have been measured for two  photon M0617  1   42 
            energy  intervals (6.4 - 6.7 and 8.5 - 9.0 MeV),  and M0617  1   43 
            theta-t between 30 and 150 deg. Monochromatic photons M0617  1   44 
            from  neutron  capture  reactions of the IPEN/CNEN-SP M0617  1   45 
            IEA-R1 research reactor were used.  The measured data M0617  1   46 
            were  analyzed in  the  framework of an alpha-cluster M0617  1   47 
            model  for  the  7Li  structure.  Results are in good M0617  1   48 
            agreement with a recent measurement  of the azimuthal M0617  1   49 
            cross section asymmetry.                              M0617  1   50
