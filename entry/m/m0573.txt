SAMPLE     As a target a 94.2 % deuterated polyethylene foil was  M0573  1   16 
            used with a total thickness of 9.76 mg/cm**2.         M0573  1   17 
ANALYSIS   The experimental data were analyzed using Monte Carlo  M0573  1   18 
            simulation of the entire reaction process, taking     M0573  1   19 
            into account the energy loss and the multiple         M0573  1   20 
            scattering of the protons in the target, the angular  M0573  1   21 
            distribution of the emitted particles, and the energy M0573  1   22 
            dependence of the cross section.                      M0573  1   23

COMMENT    The 2H(gamma,p)n cross section was measured absolutely M0573  1   25 
            at 0 degree for the outgoing proton, for photon       M0573  1   26 
            energies between 8 and 18 MeV. The rising trend       M0573  1   27 
            observed in the cross section in this energy region   M0573  1   28 
            indicates the existence of the theoretically predictedM0573  1   29 
            minimum. The results obtained at Egamma about 10 MeV  M0573  1   30 
            are well described by recent relativistic             M0573  1   31 
            calculations, the data around 15 MeV, on the contrary,M0573  1   32 
            are commonly underestimated.                          M0573  1   33
