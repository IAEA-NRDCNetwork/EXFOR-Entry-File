ANALYSIS   The (gamma,p) cross sections leading to the 39K ground M0595  1   12

            containing the (unknown) cross sections and the       M0595  1   15

             *  uncertainty in the dead time correction and an    M0595  1   20

           The differential cross section of the                  M0595  1   34 
            40Ca(gamma,p0)39K process has been measured in the    M0595  1   35 
            energy range Egamma = 100 - 300 MeV at laboratory     M0595  1   36 
            angles of 45, 90, and  135 degree. The cross section  M0595  1   37 
            for the (gamma,p) reactions leaving 39K in its ground M0595  1   38 
            state was extracted from the tip region of the proton M0595  1   39 
            spectra measured at a series of bremsstrahlung        M0595  1   40 
            end-point energies. The data were compared with a     M0595  1   41 
            distored-wave impulse-approximation calculation based M0595  1   42 
            on a direct, single-particle knockout mechanism.      M0595  1   43
