ANALYSIS   Two entirely different experimental arrangements were  M0422  1   13 
            used.  The  first,  at  angles  1.2 and 1.5 degrees,  M0422  1   14 
            utilised a shadow beam geometry in which the elastic  M0422  1   15 
            cross  section was obtained by comparing the area of  M0422  1   16 
            the elastic peak to the neighbouring Compton peak in  M0422  1   17 
            the same scattered spectrum. The second measurement,  M0422  1   18 
            for the range of angles 25 - 140 degrees,  used  the  M0422  1   19 
            conventional  method  of  comparing the intensity of  M0422  1   20 
            elastically  scattered  g-line  with  that  in   the  M0422  1   21 
            incident beam.                                        M0422  1   22
