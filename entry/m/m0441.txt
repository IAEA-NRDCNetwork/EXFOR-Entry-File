METHOD     (INTB) A G-RAY SOURCE (SB OR Y) WAS INSERTED IN THE    M044100100010 
           BERILLIUM SHELL AND CAREFULLY MOUNTED IN A CENTRAL     M044100100011 
           POSITION.                                              M044100100012 
SAMPLE     THE BERILLIUM SAMPLE WAS IN FORM OF SPHERICAL SHELL    M044100100013 
           OF INNER RADIUS R1 = 15.31 MM AND OF OUTER RADIUS      M044100100014 
           R2 = 16.81 MM (SHELL THICKNESS T = 1.5 MM). THE        M044100100015 
           SHELL WAS FOUND TO BE SPHERICAL AND OF UNIFORM         M044100100016 
           THICKNESS TO WITHIN 0.005 MM. THE MASS OF THE SHELL    M044100100017 
           WAS 8.838 G.                                           M044100100018
