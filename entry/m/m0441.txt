METHOD     (INTB) A  g-ray  source (Sb or Y) was inserted in the  M0441  1    8 
            beryllium shell and carefully mounted in  a  central  M0441  1    9 
            position.                                             M0441  1   10 
SAMPLE     The beryllium sample was in form of  spherical  shell  M0441  1   11 
            of inner radius r1 = 15.31 mm and of outer radius r2  M0441  1   12 
            = 16.81 mm (shell thickness t = 1.5 mm).  The  shell  M0441  1   13 
            was  found  to Be spherical and of uniform thickness  M0441  1   14 
            to within 0.005 mm.  The mass of the shell was 8.838  M0441  1   15 
            g.                                                    M0441  1   16 
DETECTOR   (BF3) The  neutron detector assembly consisted of BF3  M0441  1   17 
            counters embedded  in  a  5-foot  diameter  graphite  M0441  1   18 
            sphere moderator.                                     M0441  1   19 
ANALYSIS   Counting statistics of 1%  were obtained and then the  M0441  1   20 
            Be  shell was removed for the background count.  The  M0441  1   21 
            true-counts-to-background  ratio  was  approximately  M0441  1   22 
            7:1 for the y case and 70:1 for the Sb source.        M0441  1   23
