            The neutron detector consisted of a cylindrical pyrex M039200100022 
            container, 6 in. In diameter and 3 in.deep, which was M039200100023 
            filled with NE 213 liquid scintillator.  The detector M039200100024 
            was placed at 150 cm from the target at 115 deg. with M039200100025 
            respect to the  gamma  beam  and  was  shielded  from M039200100026 
            gamma-rays on the front face by 1-in. thick screen of M039200100027 
            lead.  The secondary electrons  were  detected  by  a M039200100028

ANALYSIS   To obtain a discrete probability the data were reduced M039200100031 
            to the  probability  dp(E,Eg)  that  an   interacting M039200100032 
            photon  of  energy  Eg  will produce a neutron in the M039200100033 
            energy range between  E  and  E+dE  by  dividing  the M039200100034 
            number  of observed neutrons by a factor proportional M039200100035 
            to the number of absorbed gamma-rays given by product M039200100036 
            of the measured number of incident gamma-rays and the M039200100037 
            photon-absorption   cross   section.    A    discrete M039200100038 
            probability  was  defined  as an integral of dp(E,Eg) M039200100039

COMMENT    Spectra  of  photoneutrons  from  a Bi-209 target were M039200100056 
            obtained in   the  electric  dipole  giant  resonance M039200100057 
            region (12-16 MeV).  About 88%  of  the  neutrons     M039200100058 
            ejected  by  14-MeV  gamma-rays are statistical.  The M039200100059 
            inferred level density  of  Bi-208  near  its  ground M039200100060 
            state is  not a simple function of excitation energy, M039200100061 
            but from 4 to 7 MeV it increases  exponentially  with M039200100062 
            energy. In that energy range the temperature is about M039200100063 
            1 MeV.  The nonstatistical high-energy neutrons leave M039200100064 
            the  Bi-208  nucleus  at  the  excitation energies at M039200100065 
            which   the   states   are   well   represented    as M039200100066 
            single-neutrons  holes  in Bi-209.  these high-energy M039200100067 
            neutrons are  intimately  connected  with  the  giant M039200100068 
            resonance.  If  the giant resonance is dominated by a M039200100069 
            single dipole  state,  the   absolute   width   which M039200100070 
            characterizes the  decay of the dipole state into the M039200100071 
            compound nucleus must increase by a factor of about 3 M039200100072 
            between 12 and 16 MeV.                                M039200100073
