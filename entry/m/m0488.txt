            the   errors   involved   in  absolute  photon  beam  M0488  1   12

SAMPLE     Two equivalent length absorbers consisting  of  light  M0488  1   15 
            water   ((H-2)O)   and  heavy  water  ((D-2)O).  The  M0488  1   16 
            absorbers consisted  of  stainless  steel  tubes  of  M0488  1   17 
            equal  internal  dimensions  (4.2  cm) and different  M0488  1   18 
            lengths:  about 199.3 cm (filled with  ((H-2)O)  and  M0488  1   19 
            about  200 cm (filled with ((D-2)O).  The lengths of  M0488  1   20 
            the absorbers were chosen to satisfy  the  relation:  M0488  1   21 
            l-H/l-D  =  V-H/V-D,  where  l  and  V represent the  M0488  1   22 
            lengths and molar volumes  of  the  absorbers.  With  M0488  1   23 
            this choice the atomic attenuation of the photons in  M0488  1   24 
            the two tubes becomes identical,  and the difference  M0488  1   25 
            in the transmitted intensities, which varies between  M0488  1   26 
            1.5 and 2.7% over the range of photon energies used,  M0488  1   27 
            is  entirely  due  to  the  nuclear  absorption  via  M0488  1   28 
            H-2(gamma,n) reaction.                                M0488  1   29

ANALYSIS   The absolute photodisintegration  cross  section  was  M0488  1   31 
            measured   by   comparing   the  transmitted  photon  M0488  1   32

COMMENT    Accurate absolute cross sections  for  the  deuterium  M0488  1   37 
            photodisintegration  were experimentally determined,  M0488  1   38 
            using an absorption method,  at the photon  energies  M0488  1   39 
            in  the  range  from  6 to 11 MeV with uncertainties  M0488  1   40 
            generally  less  than  3%.  The  photon  beams  were  M0488  1   41 
            produced   by   thermal  neutron  capture,  and  the  M0488  1   42 
            absorption through 2 m absorbers of H(2)O and  D(2)O  M0488  1   43 
            was measured.                                         M0488  1   44
