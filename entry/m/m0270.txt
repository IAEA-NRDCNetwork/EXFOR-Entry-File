COMMENT    The photonuclear reaction cross section 63Cu(gamma,n)  M0270  1   31 
            has   been  frequently  used  as  the  standard  for  M0270  1   32 
            (gamma,n) reactions.  The different measured  values  M0270  1   33 
            do  not  agree  with  one another and can be roughly  M0270  1   34 
            divided into two groups,  namely,  a group at  about  M0270  1   35 
            100  mb and a group at about 50 mb.  It appears that  M0270  1   36 
            the former group contains the values obtained mainly  M0270  1   37 
            by  measurements using bremsstrahlungs beams,  while  M0270  1   38 
            the latter contains those obtained mainly with  Li-p  M0270  1   39 
            gammas.                                               M0270  1   40 
           The experiment attempts to re-determine the (gamma,n)  M0270  1   41

           Absolute measurement of gamma-quanta was performed by  M0270  1   44 
            Hough's method,  and reaction yields were determined  M0270  1   45 
            by  the  activation  method  in  which  the absolute  M0270  1   46 
            numbers  of  activated  nuclei   in   samples   were  M0270  1   47 
            determined   by   measuring   the  beta-ray  with  a  M0270  1   48 
            4pi-proportional counter and applying the 'method of  M0270  1   49 
            extrapolation'.                                       M0270  1   50
