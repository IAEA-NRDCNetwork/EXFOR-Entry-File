INC-SOURCE (MPH=(28-NI-0(N,G)))     Radiative capture photons are M0431  1   10 
           compton scattered from a curved aluminium plate. The   M0431  1   11 
           energy of scattered photons was easily varied by       M0431  1   12 
           rotating and bending the scattering plate.             M0431  1   13 
SAMPLE     the targets of U-238 (enriched to 99.97%, 7.77         M0431  1   14 
           mg/cm**2) and U-235 (enriched to 97.68%, 7.25          M0431  1   15 
           mg/cm**2) were the cylindrical metal foil targets      M0431  1   16 
           5.08 cm high and 2.22 cm diameter.                     M0431  1   17

DETECTOR   (SOLST) Heavy-ion surface barrier detectors.           M0431  1   19 
           The experimental yield curves were measured using four M0431  1   20 
            detectors were mounted at 45 and 135 degrees with     M0431  1   21 
            respect to the incident photon beam.                  M0431  1   22

ANALYSIS   (INTAD,UNFLD,LEAST) The net yield curve was obtained   M0431  1   24 
            by normalization of the raw yield data followed by    M0431  1   25 
            background substraction from the total photofission   M0431  1   26 
            yield.                                                M0431  1   27 
           The average photofission cross section was determined  M0431  1   28 
            by unfolding the beam spectra from the net            M0431  1   29 
            photofission yield curve using the least-structure    M0431  1   30 
            method. Applying the appropriate target, counting     M0431  1   31 
            efficiency, and normalization factors to the average  M0431  1   32 
            cross section, the absolute cross cross section value M0431  1   33 
            were obtained.                                        M0431  1   34 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR)  The errors are the uncertainties due to    M0431  1   35 
           propagation of the yield point statistical errors      M0431  1   36 
           through the unfolding equations. The systematic errors M0431  1   37 
           were estimated to be about 30%.                        M0431  1   38 
COMMENT    Cross sections extracted from measured yield curves    M0431  1   39 
           are reported for photofission of U-238 and U-235.      M0431  1   40 
           The monoenergetic photons were obtained by compton     M0431  1   41 
           scattering g-rays produced by neutron capture in a     M0431  1   42 
           nickel plate near the core of the 5 mw ames            M0431  1   43 
           laboratory research reactor. An unfolding procedure    M0431  1   44 
           was used to extract the smoothed cross sections from   M0431  1   45 
           the measured yield curves. In the U-238(g,f) cross     M0431  1   46 
           section, prominent structure is observed at 6.2 MeV    M0431  1   47 
           and 7.6 MeV with hints of structure at 5.5 MeV and     M0431  1   48 
           7.0 MeV. The U-235(g,f) cross section shows            M0431  1   49 
           pronounced structure at 5.9 MeV, 6.6 MeV, and 7.5      M0431  1   50 
           MeV with a hint of structure at 5.4 MeV.               M0431  1   51
