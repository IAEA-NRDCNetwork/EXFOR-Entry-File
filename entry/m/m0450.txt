METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,BCINT) The   stacked-foil   method.   The  M0450  1   10 
            reaction yields were  measured  by  determining  the  M0450  1   11 
            radioactivity   of   the  ten-minute  copper-62  and  M0450  1   12 
            three-hour copper-61 nuclei which results  from  the  M0450  1   13 
            (gamma,n) and (gamma,2n) processes, respectively, in  M0450  1   14 
            copper-63.  The number of photoneutrons ejected from  M0450  1   15 
            the  copper  foil  was  determined  by  counting the  M0450  1   16 
            residual  radioactivity  of  the  Cu-62  and   Cu-61  M0450  1   17 
            isotopes with 4pi scintillation counter.              M0450  1   18 
SAMPLE     The natural-copper foils used in the  (gamma,n)  runs  M0450  1   19 
            were 1.25-inch diameter disks 40 mg/cm2 thick, while  M0450  1   20 
            the enriched foils were 0.5 inch x 0.75-inch  strips  M0450  1   21 
            totaling 65 mg/cm2. Highly-enriched copper-63 foils:  M0450  1   22 
            copper  oxide  containing  99.4%  copper-63.   Foils  M0450  1   23 
            ranging  in  thickness  from  3  to  16  mg/cm2  and  M0450  1   24 
            totaling 130 mg/cm2 were made.                        M0450  1   25 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4Pi  scintillation  counter:  the   foil   was  M0450  1   26 
            sandwiched  between  two  flat  anthracene crystals,  M0450  1   27 
            1.-inch square and 0.125-inch thick,  backed by  two  M0450  1   28 
            DuMont 6292 photomultipliers.                         M0450  1   29 
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,PHDIF) The  number  of  photoneutrons  ejected  M0450  1   30 
            from  the copper foil was determined by counting the  M0450  1   31 
            residual  radioactivity  of  the  Cu-62  and   Cu-61  M0450  1   32 
            isotopes with 4pi scintillation counter.  Activation  M0450  1   33 
            points were taken at  2  MeV  intervals.  The  cross  M0450  1   34 
            sections   were  computed  from  experimental  yield  M0450  1   35 
            curves  by  applying  the  photon-difference  method  M0450  1   36 
            using  bremsstrahlung  distributions calculated at 2  M0450  1   37 
            MeV intervals for  a  0.025-radiation-length  copper  M0450  1   38 
            radiator.                                             M0450  1   39 
CORRECTION The cross   sections   given   were   corrected   for  M0450  1   40 
            contributions  caused  by  the  competing three-hour  M0450  1   41 
            activity of Cu-61 (from  Cu-63(g,2n)  reaction)  for  M0450  1   42 
            twelve-hour    Cu-64   activity   (from   Cu-65(g,n)  M0450  1   43 
            reaction) which was evaluated by counting  it  after  M0450  1   44 
            decay  of  the  three-hour  Cu-61  activity and then  M0450  1   45 
            correcting by extrapolating  back  to  the  original  M0450  1   46 
            Cu-64  activity  and  for multiple scattering of the  M0450  1   47 
            primary electrons from Linac in the foils  increases  M0450  1   48 
            the  effective  path  length  of  the bremsstrahlung  M0450  1   49 
            quanta and electrons in the rear  foil  relative  to  M0450  1   50 
            the  first  (a correction for this was applied which  M0450  1   51 
            varied from 4.0 to 0.4% from 12 to 36 MeV).           M0450  1   52 
COMMENT    Experimental values were found for the absolute cross  M0450  1   53 
            section  of  both  Cu-63(gamma,n)   and   (gamma,2n)  M0450  1   54 
            reactions  versus gamma-quanta energy from threshold  M0450  1   55 
            to 36 MeV.  Statistical and systematic  errors  were  M0450  1   56 
            limited by the use of:                                M0450  1   57 
             (a) the direct electron beam of the Stanford 36 MeV  M0450  1   58 
                 linear     accelerator,     which      produced  M0450  1   59 
                 bremsstrahlung  immediately  before  and within  M0450  1   60 
                 the copper foils under bombardment,              M0450  1   61 
             (b) an electron-beam collector which  recorded  the  M0450  1   62 
                 total accumulated charge in the incident flux,   M0450  1   63 
             (c) a  4pi scintillation counter which measured the  M0450  1   64 
                 activity of the resultant Cu-62 and Cu-61,       M0450  1   65 
             (d) electroplated   foils   of   separated    Cu-63  M0450  1   66 
                 isotopes.                                        M0450  1   67
