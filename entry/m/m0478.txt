           ENERGIES BETWEEN 8.5 AND 22 MEV. THE FACT THAT THE     M047800100031 
           INCIDENT PHOTON MOMENTUM IS SMALL AT THESE ENERGIES    M047800100032 
           PROVIDES A UNIQUE SIGNATURE FOR THIS PROCESS. THE      M047800100033 
           PROTON AND DEUTERON ARE EMITTED NEARLY BACK TO BACK    M047800100034 
           WITH EQUAL MOMENTA; HENCE THE ENERGY OF THE PROTON     M047800100035
