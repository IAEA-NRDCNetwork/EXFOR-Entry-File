COMMENT    New measurements  of  the  photoneutron  reaction  on  M066400100025 
            181Ta have been conducted with the  AIST-LCS  (laser  M066400100026 
            Compton  scattering)  beam  in  the  7.8  - 12.0 MeV  M066400100027 
            energy range.  The major advantage  of  the  present  M066400100028 
            g-ray  experiment  is  its  intense  peaking  in the  M066400100029 
            energy window of astrophysical interest, i.e., close  M066400100030 
            to  the  neutron threshold.  Details on photon beams  M066400100031 
            from the laser Compton scattering, neutron counting,  M066400100032 
            and   experimental   determination   of   the  181Ta  M066400100033 
            photoneutron cross section are  given.  The  present  M066400100034 
            experimental  data  are  in  good agreemrnt with the  M066400100035 
            IAEA evaluation.  Reaction rate calculations at  the  M066400100036 
            Hauser-Feashbach statistical model are performed and  M066400100037 
            confronted with  the  experimental  data.  The  data  M066400100038 
            provide  constraints  on  the low-energy tail of the  M066400100039 
            dipole strength function.  It was found  that  among  M066400100040 
            the  three  different  models  for  the  E1-strength  M066400100041 
            considered,  only  the   microscopic   quasiparticle  M066400100042 
            random phase  approximation  model can reproduce the  M066400100043 
            extra  strength  observed  in  the   181Ta(g,n)180Ta  M066400100044 
            reaction  at  energies  of  about  8.5 MeV.  Such an  M066400100045 
            experiment helps to improve the determination of the  M066400100046 
            corresponding  stellar  photodisintegration  rate of  M066400100047 
            181Ta  which  directly  influences   the   p-process  M066400100048 
            production of 180Ta.                                  M066400100049
