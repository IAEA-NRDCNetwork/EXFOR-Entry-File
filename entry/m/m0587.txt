COMMENT    The absolute photofission cross section of 209Bi       M0587  1   19 
            has been measured with monoenergetic gamma-radiation  M0587  1   20 
            between 40 and 65 MeV photon energy. The experimental M0587  1   21 
            result was compared with the excitation function      M0587  1   22 
            calculated on the basis of the statistical model.     M0587  1   23 
            In order to reproduce the measured data on            M0587  1   24 
            sigma(gamma,f), the (gamma,n) cross section must      M0587  1   25 
            decrease with increasing photon energy faster than    M0587  1   26 
            the experimental total (gamma,n) cross section. This  M0587  1   27 
            behavior can possibly be explained by assumption      M0587  1   28 
            that after photon absorption a compound nucleus       M0587  1   29 
            is formed only for a small, with photon energy        M0587  1   30 
            decreasing, fraction of all decays.                   M0587  1   31
