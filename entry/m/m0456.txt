SAMPLE     A very thin (0.16 mm) aluminium tube (15 cm in length  M0456  1   16 
            and 1.5 cm in diameter), with end caps of lexan, was  M0456  1   17 
            filled  with deuterium or hydrogen (in turn) at high  M0456  1   18 
            preasure (about 30 atm).                              M0456  1   19

ANALYSIS   Data were  taken  in  several runs with deuterium and  M0456  1   22 
            hydrogen gas  (for  background  measurements).  Data  M0456  1   23 
            were  also taken with use of only the bremsstrahlung  M0456  1   24 
            component of the beam.  Data were reduced  to  cross  M0456  1   25 
            sections   in   several   steps.   By  use  of  both  M0456  1   26 
            pulseshape-analyser  and  head/tail  information,  a  M0456  1   27 
            highquality  p/g discrimination was obtained.  Next,  M0456  1   28 
            the bremsstrahlung data were normalized to the  same  M0456  1   29 
            total electron flux and substracted.  Then,  the net  M0456  1   30 
            hydrogen yield was substracted  from  the  deuterium  M0456  1   31 
            yield,  to  get  rid of the residual electromagnetic  M0456  1   32 
            background and the spurious counts  from  the  lexan  M0456  1   33 
            windows.                                              M0456  1   34 
CORRECTION Corrections were  made  for   the   proton   detector  M0456  1   35 
            efficiency,  including  the  effect  of  the  proton  M0456  1   36 
            energy threshold (0.7 MeV at  Eg  =  14.7  MeV)  and  M0456  1   37 
            angular acceptance.                                   M0456  1   38

COMMENT    The total  cross  section  for photodisintegration of  M0456  1   40 
            deuteron has been measured in the g-ray energy range  M0456  1   41 
            between  15  and 75 MeV,  by use of the monocromatic  M0456  1   42 
            'LADON'  photon  beam  of  the   Frascati   National  M0456  1   43
