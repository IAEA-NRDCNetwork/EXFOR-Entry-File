COMMENT    The exclusive 16O(G,PN)14N-0,1,2,... reaction was      M0627  1   32 
            measured for the photon energy range E(G) = 98.5 -    M0627  1   33 
            141.0 MeV with an excitation energy resolution of 2.8 M0627  1   34 
            MeV. Protons were detected at 76 and 82 degrees and   M0627  1   35 
            coincident neutrons were detected at the opening      M0627  1   36 
            angle for quasifree deuteron photodisintegration.     M0627  1   37 
            Only the T = 0, 1+, 3.95 MeV state in the residual    M0627  1   38 
            14N nucleus was significantly populated.  This        M0627  1   39 
            corresponds to a preferred l = 0 angular momentum     M0627  1   40 
            transfer to the recoil as is expected for quasifree   M0627  1   41 
            kinematics. The absence of significant population  to M0627  1   42 
            other discrete states is evidence that absorption on  M0627  1   43 
            correlated proton-neutron pairs with an angular       M0627  1   44 
            momentum transfer of l >= 2 is largely suppressed for M0627  1   45 
            the low recoil momentum range of the current          M0627  1   46 
            measurement.  As a consequence of this fact, and the  M0627  1   47 
            absence of unnatural parity states, only absorption   M0627  1   48 
            on proton-neutron pairs in relative motion l = 0, 2   M0627  1   49 
            is expected for all possible shell model coupling. No M0627  1   50 
            significant population of the T = 1 state at 2.31 MeV M0627  1   51 
            is consistent with previous measurement demonstrating M0627  1   52 
            that absorption on proton-neutron pairs in an isospin M0627  1   53 
            triplet is suppressed. The results of the measurement M0627  1   54 
            to discrete states in the residual 14N nucleus are    M0627  1   55 
            compared to microscopic calculations which include    M0627  1   56 
            contributions above that the mean field due to the    M0627  1   57 
            short range and tensor parts of the nuclear           M0627  1   58 
            potential. Clear separation in the contribution of    M0627  1   59 
            (1p)**-2 and (1p)**-1 (1s)**-1 continuum above 20 MeV M0627  1   60 
            indicates that absorption on l = 1 nucleon pairs is   M0627  1   61 
            also important near quasifree kinematics.             M0627  1   62
