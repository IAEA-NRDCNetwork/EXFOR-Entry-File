METHOD     (COINC) The photoprotons were detected in crystal and  M0460  1   11 
            the   associated   photoneutrons  were  detected  in  M0460  1   12 
            delayed coincidence  in  a  stilbene  crystal  at  a  M0460  1   13 
            distance of 170 mm.                                   M0460  1   14 
SAMPLE     The deuterated anthracene scintillation  crystal  was  M0460  1   15 
            used  simultaneously  as  target  and  as photoroton  M0460  1   16

ANALYSIS   Photodisintegration runs were made at six  laboratory  M0460  1   21 
            angles  Theta-n  = 30,  45,  60,  90,  120,  and 135  M0460  1   22 
            degrees.  For each angle the photoneutron yield  was  M0460  1   23 
            determined   by   integrating   the  counts  in  the  M0460  1   24 
            photoneutron peak and by normalizing to  a  constant  M0460  1   25 
            flux of incident 2.75 MeV gamma rays.                 M0460  1   26 
CORRECTION Corrections were made for background,  geometry, dead  M0460  1   27 
            time  losses,  and  relative detection efficiency of  M0460  1   28 
            neutron detector.                                     M0460  1   29

COMMENT    The angular distribution of  neutrons  from  deuteron  M0460  1   31 
            photodisintegration  by  2.75  MeV  gamma  rays  was  M0460  1   32 
            measured at six laboratory angles between 30 and 135  M0460  1   33 
            degrees. The dipole cross section ratio sig-m/ sig-e  M0460  1   34 
            = 0.290 (0.021) was derieved from the  measurements.  M0460  1   35 
            The  least  squares  fit  to angular distribution of  M0460  1   36 
            neutrons led to the value a/b = 0.193 (0.014).        M0460  1   37
