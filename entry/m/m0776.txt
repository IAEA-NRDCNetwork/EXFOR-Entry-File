SAMPLE     The 197Au targets used were thin discs with a typical  M077600100015 
            mass of about 200 mg,  a thickness of 0.02 mm, and a  M077600100016

METHOD     (ACTIV) The 197Au(g,n) reaction produces the unstable  M077600100020 
            nucleus  196Au  that  decays  either  to  196Pt   by  M077600100021 
            electron  capture  or positron emission (EC + beta+)  M077600100022 
            or to 196Hg by beta decay (beta-).                    M077600100023

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties presented in Fig.  8 are  M077600100025 
            mainly from the determination of photon fluence. The  M077600100026 
            statistical  uncertainties are very small and in the  M077600100027 
            order of about 0.5 - 2.0  %.                          M077600100028 
           (ERR-1) The  systematic  uncertainties arise from the  M077600100029 
            extrapolation of measured photopeak efficiencies  to  M077600100030 
            the higher energies in 11B transitions (5 %).         M077600100031 
           (ERR-2) The systematic uncertainties arise  from  the  M077600100032 
            systematic deviation of measured photon fluence from  M077600100033 
            the simulated curve (6 %).                            M077600100034 
           The total   systematic   errors  have  been  obtained  M077600100035 
            quadratically and amount to be about 7.8 %.           M077600100036
