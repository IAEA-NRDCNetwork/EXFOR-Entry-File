METHOD     (ACTIV) The 197Au(g,n) reaction produces the unstable  M0776  1   20

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties presented in Fig.  8 are  M0776  2   13 
            mainly from the determination of photon fluence. The  M0776  2   14 
            statistical  uncertainties are very small and in the  M0776  2   15 
            order of about 0.5 - 2.0  %.                          M0776  2   16 
           (ERR-1) The  systematic  uncertainties arise from the  M0776  2   17 
            extrapolation of measured photopeak efficiencies  to  M0776  2   18 
            the higher energies in 11B transitions (5 %).         M0776  2   19 
           (ERR-2) The systematic uncertainties arise  from  the  M0776  2   20 
            systematic deviation of measured photon fluence from  M0776  2   21 
            the simulated curve (6 %).                            M0776  2   22 
           The total   systematic   errors  have  been  obtained  M0776  2   23 
            quadratically and amount to be about 7.8 %.           M0776  2   24
