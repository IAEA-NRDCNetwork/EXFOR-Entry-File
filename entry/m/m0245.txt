COMMENT    The photodisintegration  of  Li-6  by  bremsstrahlung  M0245  1   17 
            radiation   of   17.3-MeV   end-point   energy   was  M0245  1   18 
            investigated by use  of  coincidence  techniques  to  M0245  1   19 
            detect    neutron-proton    coincidences    and   by  M0245  1   20 
            measurement of the photoproton energy  spectra.  The  M0245  1   21 
            Li-6(gamma,n)  reaction  is  found to Be responsible  M0245  1   22 
            for 0.58(0.13) of the photoneutron yield measured by  M0245  1   23 
            Romanowski    while   the   Li-6(g,p)He-5   reaction  M0245  1   24 
            contributes 0.31(0.04) of the  yield.  No  angularly  M0245  1   25 
            correlated neutron-proton coincidences were detected  M0245  1   26 
            which would support a deuteron-alpha-particle  model  M0245  1   27 
            for   the   Li-6(g,np)He-4   reaction;   however,the  M0245  1   28 
            possible  existence  of   this   reaction   is   not  M0245  1   29 
            eliminated.                                           M0245  1   30
