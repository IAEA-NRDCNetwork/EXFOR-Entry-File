COMMENT    Energy distributions of photodeuterons from Li-7 are   M011600100015 
           measured at various values of the bremsstrahlung       M011600100016 
           end-point energy. The difference spectra of deuterons  M011600100017 
           show that in the Li-7 giant resonance region an        M011600100018 
           intensive (g,d-0) reaction proceeds with production of M011600100019 
           the He-5 nucleus in its ground state. A group of       M011600100020 
           deuterons which may be due to the (g,d-1) reaction withM011600100021 
           production of a final nucleus in the first excited     M011600100022 
           state is found. The integral cross section of those    M011600100023 
           reactions (under an assumption that the (g,d           M011600100024 
           reaction really proceeds) are obtained to be           M011600100025 
           correspondingly 4.0(0.5) and 3.2(0.7) MeV*mb for       M011600100026 
           Eg=16.5-:30 MeV. Besides, there was observed an        M011600100027 
           emission of deuterons which fact should be due to the  M011600100028 
           decay of the 7-Li states with 25-30 MeV energies into  M011600100029 
           n+d+(he-4) (5(2) MeV*mb) as well as due to some        M011600100030 
           complicated decays of li-7(=5. MeV*mb) induced by      M011600100031 
           37-50 MeV g-quanta.                                    M011600100032 
           The contribution of various channels to the yield of   M011600100033 
           photodeutrons from the Li-7 nucleus were obtained by   M011600100034 
           means of comparison of these spectra.                  M011600100035
