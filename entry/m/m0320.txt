INC-SPECT  Lithium proton-capture gamma rays were obtained  from  M0320  1    9 
            narrow  line  at  17.6 MeV  and a broad line at 14.8  M0320  1   10 
            MeV.  All gamma rays were associated  with  441  keV  M0320  1   11 
            resonance.  The  relative intensity of 17.6 and 14.8  M0320  1   12 
            MeV components was about 1.7 : 1.                     M0320  1   13

SAMPLE     High-purity powder  samples  of thirteen elements (of  M0320  1   16 
            atomic  numbers  ranging  from  26   to   83)   were  M0320  1   17 
            irradiated  in  thin aluminum cylindrical containers  M0320  1   18 
            which fit over the proton beam tube and thus subtend  M0320  1   19 
            almost the total solid angle at the lithium target.   M0320  1   20 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A cylindrical crystal 1.5 inch  by  1.5  inch  M0320  1   21 
            was used to monitor the gamma rays intensity.         M0320  1   22 
           Two groups of four counters (1 inch diam. by 4.5 inch  M0320  1   23 
            active length) were used:                             M0320  1   24 
          1(BF3) Group A:                                         M0320  1   25 
            Four counters consisted of two counters above and two M0320  1   26 
            counters below the sample.                            M0320  1   27 
          2(BF3) Group B:                                         M0320  1   28 
            Four counters formed a square array above the sample  M0320  1   29 
            at 90 deg to the protons beam. The counters of this   M0320  1   30 
            group were placed closer to the target.               M0320  1   31 
MONITOR    To determine  the  absolute  energy  of  the  neutron  M0320  1   32 
            counters Ra-Be neutrons source were used, calibrated  M0320  1   33 
            by the National Bureau of  Standards.  Its  absolute  M0320  1   34 
            strength was estimated to be 5%.                      M0320  1   35

            The efficiency of detection systems was measured for  M0320  1   37 
            different energy of neutrons.                         M0320  1   38 
ANALYSIS   The cross sections for photoneutron  production  were  M0320  1   39 
            calculated from neutron yields,  which were measured  M0320  1   40 
            at all energies of gamma rays.                        M0320  1   41 
          1Group A:                                               M0320  1   42 
            The efficiency of the counters does not depend on     M0320  1   43 
            the neutrons energy.                                  M0320  1   44 
          2Group B:                                               M0320  1   45 
            The efficiency of the counters depends strongly on    M0320  1   46 
            the  neutrons energy (near to 1/E).                   M0320  1   47

            The  uncertainty in absolute value of each cross      M0320  1   49 
            section is to be 15%, determined chiefly by the       M0320  1   50 
            uncertainties in the neutron and photon  detector     M0320  1   51 
            efficiencies. The relative cross-section values for   M0320  1   52 
            the different elements are known to better than 10%.  M0320  1   53 
          2No information on the uncertainty.                     M0320  1   54 
COMMENT    The energies of lithium gamma line are  presented  as  M0320  1   55 
            high  and low values of limit of gamma quanta energy  M0320  1   56 
            Eg-min and Eg-max, respectively.                      M0320  1   57 
           Since the results for Group B  depend on the           M0320  1   58 
            assumptions made about the photoneutron energy        M0320  1   59 
            spectra, authors believe the Group A values to be     M0320  1   60 
            more accurate than those obtained with Group B.       M0320  1   61
