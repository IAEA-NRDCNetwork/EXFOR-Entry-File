COMMENT    The isomeric ratios (IR) were measured in the isotones M0629  1   37 
            with N = 81 (135Xe,  137Ba, 139Ce, 141Nd, and 143Sm). M0629  1   38 
            Isomers with   J-PI  =  11/2-  were  excited  in  the M0629  1   39 
            reactions (n,g),  (g,n),  and b+ - decay of 139Pr and M0629  1   40 
            141Pm. The    activation    methods   of   g-spectrum M0629  1   41 
            measurement was used. The marked difference of Ir was M0629  1   42 
            observed in  the  isotones  with the different atomic M0629  1   43 
            numbers Z but in the same reactions. The calculations M0629  1   44 
            of Ir   using   low-level   spectrum   and  radiation M0629  1   45 
            transitions on the base of the  quasiparticle  phonon M0629  1   46 
            model were  performed.  The satisfactory agreement of M0629  1   47 
            the measured and calculated Ir was obtained  for  all M0629  1   48 
            studied isotopes.  The  dependence  of  Ir  on  Z  is M0629  1   49 
            explained by the different  energy  of  reaction  and M0629  1   50
