ANALYSIS   The detection process permits the measurement of       M041500100016 
           the photoneutron multiplicity "I" and therefore the    M041500100017 
           simultaneous and independent measurement of each       M041500100018

           sig(g,in) for each value of photon energy Eg.          M041500100020 
ERR-ANALYS The errors presented are resulted from the             M041500100021 
           combination in quadrature of the purely                M041500100022 
           statistical uncertanties of the photoneutron           M041500100023 
           counting rates (including background subtraction),     M041500100024 
           the mostly statistical uncertainties related to        M041500100025 
           photon beam, and the mostly systematic uncertainties   M041500100026 
           associated with the neutron-detector efficiency.       M041500100027

           for O-16 have been measured with monoenergetic         M041500100031 
           photons in the energy range above the giant            M041500100032
