SAMPLE     Nuclear emulsions loaded with the isotope  Li-7  were  M0434  1   13 
            used as a target and as a detector simultaneously.    M0434  1   14

DETECTOR   (PLATE) NIKFI-T3   type   plates   with  an  emulsion  M0434  1   16

ANALYSIS   Plates loaded   and   not   loaded   with  Li-7  were  M0434  1   20 
            irradiated under identical conditions.  The unloaded  M0434  1   21 
            plate was used for background measurements. The laws  M0434  1   22 
            of energy and momentum  conservation  were  used  to  M0434  1   23 
            identify the reactions.                               M0434  1   24 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The errors are statistical.                    M0434  1   25 
COMMENT    A search  was made for the reaction Li-7(gamma,pt)H-3  M0434  1   26 
            (Q = 22.28 MeV) in the gamma-ray energy range  23  -  M0434  1   27 
            27  MeV  using  thick  nuclear  emulsion loaded with  M0434  1   28 
            isotope Li-7.  The momentum and energy  conservation  M0434  1   29 
            laws   were  used  to  identify  the  reaction.  The  M0434  1   30 
            integrated reaction cross section in  the  mentioned  M0434  1   31 
            energy region was obtained.                           M0434  1   32
