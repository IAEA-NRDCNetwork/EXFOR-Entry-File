SAMPLE     Two sets of targets.  The criogenic targets consisted  M066600100026 
            of  three  pairs of 5 cm diameter flasks,  each pair  M066600100027 
            comprising nominal 4 cm and 15 cm long flasks filled  M066600100028 
            with liquid deuterium,  liquid hydrogen, and vacuum,  M066600100029 
            respectively.  Seven additional targets -  all  thin  M066600100030 
            0.33 g/cm**2 carbon slabs.                            M066600100031 
ANALYSIS   The cross section at each photon energy and angle was  M066600100032 
            extracted from four separate  measurements:  (1)  Cu  M066600100033 
            radiator  and  liquid  deuterium (LD2) target in the  M066600100034 
            beam (Nrd);  (2) Cu  radiator  and  liquid  hydrogen  M066600100035 
            (LH2)  target  in the beam (Nrh);  (3) LD2 target in  M066600100036 
            the beam and no radiator (Nod);  and (4) LH2  target  M066600100037 
            in the beam and no radiator. The yield from deuteron  M066600100038 
            photodesintegration was obtained from the  following  M066600100039 
            expression: Nd = (Nrd - Nrh) - (Nod - Noh).           M066600100040 
           The measured photofission yield  was  converted  into  M066600100041 
            absolute  photofission  cross section by summing the  M066600100042 
            contributions to fission events due to  all  photons  M066600100043 
            of  energy  between  the  photofission threshold and  M066600100044 
            end-point energy in energy spectrum of the  incident  M066600100045 
            photons.                                              M066600100046

COMMENT    The differential  cross  sections  for  the  reaction  M066600100048 
            2H(g,p)n has been measured at several center-of-mass  M066600100049 
            angles  ranging  from  50  to  143 degree for photon  M066600100050 
            energies between 0.8 and 1.8 GeV. The experiment was  M066600100051 
            performed  at the SLAC-NPAS facility with the use of  M066600100052 
            the 1.6 GeV/c spectrometer to detect the high energy  M066600100053 
            protons  produced  by a bremsstrahlung beam directed  M066600100054 
            at a liquid  deuterium  target.  Contributions  from  M066600100055 
            concurrent  disintegration  by the residual electron  M066600100056 
            beam were determined by measuring the  proton  yield  M066600100057 
            without  the Cu photon radiator.  At angles not very  M066600100058 
            far from 90 degree,  the energy  dependence  of  the  M066600100059 
            cross  sections  is  consistent  with predictions of  M066600100060 
            scaling   using  counting  rules   for  constituent   M066600100061 
            quarks.  At  least one theoretical calculation based  M066600100062 
            on a meson-baryon picture of the reaction is able to  M066600100063 
            reproduce the magnitude and energy dependence of the  M066600100064 
            90 degree cross section.  The  angular  distribution  M066600100065 
            exhibits  a  large enhancement at backward angles at  M066600100066 
            the higher energies.                                  M066600100067
