COMMENT    The  comparison of  the various photonuclear  reaction M0371  1   20 
            cross section  data for  Cu-63,nat  published earlier M0371  1   21 
            and the detailed analysis of conditions in which they M0371  1   22 
            have  been obtained was carried out.  To overcome the M0371  1   23

            determination.  The data obtained for  this  reaction M0371  1   28 
            were  used  for  evaluation of new cross section data M0371  1   29 
            for Cu-65,nat (gamma,np) reactions.                   M0371  1   30
