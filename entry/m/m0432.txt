           A variable-energy  beam  of monoenergetic photons was  M0432  1   10 
            obtained by Compton scattering the primary  beam  of  M0432  1   11 
            radiative  capture  photons  from an aluminium plate  M0432  1   12 
            with a continuously variable radius of curvature.     M0432  1   13 
SAMPLE     The target   of  Th-232  consisted  of  156.4  mg  of  M0432  1   14 
            material (4.4 mg/cm**2)  and  was  assayed  at  100%  M0432  1   15 
            Th-232.  The  U-236  target  consisted  of 317 mg of  M0432  1   16 
            material (8.9 mg/cm**2)  assayed  at  89.38%  U-236,  M0432  1   17 
            9.20% U-235, 1.306% U-238, and 0.116% U-234.          M0432  1   18

            Each  of  four  detectors used was positioned on the  M0432  1   20 
            rod located  at  45  degrees  with  respect  to  the  M0432  1   21 
            gamma-ray beam.                                       M0432  1   22

METHOD     (EXTB) The yield points were formed from the sum of    M0432  1   24 
            events in the four detectors.                         M0432  1   25 
           Compton scattering facility used provides a photon     M0432  1   26 
            beam with a continuous energy distribution, rather    M0432  1   27 
            than one discrete energy. hence, the photofission     M0432  1   28 
            cross section could not be obtained directly, but     M0432  1   29 
            were  extracted  from  a  measurement  of fission     M0432  1   30 
            yield as a function of end-point energy.              M0432  1   31 
ANALYSIS   (UNFLD,LEAST) The unfolding procedure was the          M0432  1   32 
            modification of least structure method of Cook: the   M0432  1   33 
            cook's routine was developed for use not              M0432  1   34 
            bremsstrahlung spectrum, but the specific spectrum    M0432  1   35 
            of Compton scattered monoenergetic photons.           M0432  1   36

COMMENT    Measurements of  the  photofission  cross sections of  M0432  1   42 
            Th-232 and U-236 for an energy range of 5.0  to  8.0  M0432  1   43 
            MeV are reported. The compton scattering facility at  M0432  1   44 
            ames laboratory research reactor was used for  these  M0432  1   45 
            measurements.  Resonance structure at g-ray energies  M0432  1   46 
            of 6.3 and 7.6 MeV is observed in Th-232 and at 5.3,  M0432  1   47 
            6.0, 6.5, and 7.5 MeV in U-236.                       M0432  1   48
