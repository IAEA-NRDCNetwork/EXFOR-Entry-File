COMMENT    The cross section of the reaction Cu-63(g,n)Cu-62 for  M027100100012 
            Li gamma rays was measured in order to discover some  M027100100013 
            causes of the existing discrepancy between values     M027100100014 
            measured by bremsstrahlungs and by nuclear gamma rays M027100100015 
            Experimental procedures used in this experiment were  M027100100016 
            much improved as compared with those used in previous M027100100017 
            measurements performed in laboratory for the same     M027100100018 
            purpose.                                              M027100100019 
           The present results were as follows:                   M027100100020 
              sigma(Li-g)=62(4) mb (for Li gamma rays), and       M027100100021 
              sigma(eg=17.6)=76(5)  b for 17.6 MeV gamma-rays.    M027100100022 
           This value is about 30% lower than the average cross   M027100100023 
            section value determined by photon difference method  M027100100024 
            in several bremsstrahlung' experiments.               M027100100025 
           Therefore, we suggest that the modified spectrum metho M027100100026 
            proposed by penfold and leiss might eliminate not onl M027100100027 
            the above-mentioned discrepancy but also the          M027100100028 
            discrepancy between theoretical and experimental      M027100100029 
            values in the form  sig**(-2), as pointed out by      M027100100030
