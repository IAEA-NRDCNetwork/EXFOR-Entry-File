COMMENT    There exists significant disagreement in the           M044800100010

           cross section as measured by three methods:            M044800100012 
           direct neutron detection, induced activity, and        M044800100013 
           neutron time-of-flight. This paper reports two         M044800100014 
           measurements of this reaction cross section, one       M044800100015 
           from threshold to 16.5 mev using an activation         M044800100016 
           method, and the other from threshold to 15.5 mev       M044800100017 
           by directly detecting the emitted neutrons.            M044800100018
