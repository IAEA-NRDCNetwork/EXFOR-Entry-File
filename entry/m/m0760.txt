ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) Starting  from  the  high-energy  end  of  an  M076000100018 
            experimental spectrum,  which contain transitions to  M076000100019 
            the ground state only,  the simulated intensities of  M076000100020 
            the  transitions  to  the  ground state (Monte Carlo  M076000100021 
            procedure) were normalized to the experimental  once  M076000100022 
            and the  intensity  distribution  of  the  branching  M076000100023 
            transitions was  subtracted  from  the  experimental  M076000100024 
            spectrum. Dividing    the    intensities    of   the  M076000100025 
            transitions to   the   ground   state,   which   are  M076000100026
