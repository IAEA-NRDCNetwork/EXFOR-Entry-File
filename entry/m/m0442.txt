INC-SOURCE  Decay gammas from 124Sb (1.692 MeV),                  M0442  1    8 
                  206Bi(1.720 MeV) and 28Al(1.780 MeV).           M0442  1    9 
METHOD     (MANGB) The neutron yield was determined by comparing  M0442  1   10 
            the (radioactive source - Be) photoneutron source to  M0442  1   11 
            a Ra-Be standard source by means of a manganous       M0442  1   12 
            sulfate bath (measurements of saturated manganese     M0442  1   13 
            activity).                                            M0442  1   14 
SAMPLE     The beryllium sample was in form of spherical shell    M0442  1   15 
            with  outside diameter of 8.2 cm and a thickness      M0442  1   16 
            of 0.645 cm.                                          M0442  1   17 
PART-DET   (B-)  Saturated manganese activity.                    M0442  1   18 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The saturated activity of manganese in         M0442  1   19 
           manganous sulfate bath was measured by Geiger tube.    M0442  1   20 
CORRECTION Some kinds of corrections to the data were used.       M0442  1   21 
            These were corrections for:                           M0442  1   22 
            - peak-to-total ratio;                                M0442  1   23 
            - substraction of 2.09 MeV Compton tail;              M0442  1   24 
            - half-life of Sb-124;                                M0442  1   25 
            - absolute strength of source;                        M0442  1   26 
            - neutron escape from manganous sulfate bath;         M0442  1   27 
            - capture of fast neutrons in bath;                   M0442  1   28 
            - neutron counting statistics;                        M0442  1   29 
            - finite source-size;                                 M0442  1   30 
            - gamma-ray attenuation in the Be shell;              M0442  1   31 
            - neutrons produced by 2.09 MeV gamma rays.           M0442  1   32 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors given for cross section values   M0442  1   33 
            are over-all uncertainties (square root of sum of     M0442  1   34 
            squares).                                             M0442  1   35
