COMMENT    Tagged photons  produced  by the ROKK-2 facility have  M067200100032 
            been used to measure the photofission cross  section  M067200100033 
            of 209Bi  in the energy range 60 - 270 MeV.  Fission  M067200100034 
            events were detected by  using  a  nuclear  fragment  M067200100035 
            detector based    on   multiwire   spark   counters.  M067200100036 
            Fissility values have been deduced and compared with  M067200100037 
            available data  obtained  with monochromatic photons  M067200100038 
            in othder  laboratories.  These   data   have   been  M067200100039 
            analysed in  the  framework of a two-step model wich  M067200100040 
            considers the primary photointegration occuring  via  M067200100041 
            the quasi-deuteron  and/or  photomesonic  processes,  M067200100042 
            followed by   mechanism    of    evaporation-fission  M067200100043 
            competition for  the  excited residual nucleus.  The  M067200100044 
            model was found to reproduce the  main  experimental  M067200100045 
            features of 209Bi photofissility up to 300 MeV.       M067200100046
