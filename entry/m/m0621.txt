COMMENT    The 24Na and 28Mg radionuclides have been detected  by M0621  1   17 
            their   gamma-activity   using   radiochemistry.  The M0621  1   18 
            purified Th-targets were activated by  bremsstrahlung M0621  1   19 
            at end-point energies  E-E  =  12, 16.5, and  24 MeV. M0621  1   20 
            Possible backgrounds are carefully analyzed,  and the M0621  1   21 
            yields of the light nuclei have been found on a level M0621  1   22 
            of 10**(-6) per fission event.                        M0621  1   23
