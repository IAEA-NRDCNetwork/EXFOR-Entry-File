COMMENT    The yields of ternary fission of Nb and Ag nuclei      M0567  1   25 
            induced by bremsstrahlung photons of 0.8, 1.0, 1.4    M0567  1   26 
            and 1.8 GeV end-point energies have been measured by  M0567  1   27 
            using the 2pi-forward geometry with thick target      M0567  1   28 
            metal foils in contact with makrofol polycarbonate    M0567  1   29 
            sheets as fission-track detectors. Absolute mean      M0567  1   30 
            cross sections  per photon in the range (0.8 - 1.8)   M0567  1   31 
            GeV have been obtained as 0.3+-0.3 and 0.5+-0.4       M0567  1   32 
            microbarn, respectively, for Nb and Ag nuclei.        M0567  1   33 
            These  correspond to a probability of ternary         M0567  1   34 
            fission of about 10**(-5) for both nuclei. Results    M0567  1   35 
            were discussed and compared with previous ternary     M0567  1   36 
            fission data obtained for nuclei of A < 90.           M0567  1   37
