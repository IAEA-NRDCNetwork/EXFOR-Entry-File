METHOD     (EXTB,PHD) The  energy  separation of the protons and  M0470  1   10 
            deuterons  from  He-3  was  achieved  by  pulseshape  M0470  1   11 
            discrimination.   Number  of  silicon detectors with  M0470  1   12 
            depletion depths ranging from 0.045 to 3.0  mm  were  M0470  1   13 
            used  either  singly  or  in  combinations of two to  M0470  1   14 
            separate protons and deuterons from  the  background  M0470  1   15 
            due to electrons and neutrons.                        M0470  1   16 
SAMPLE     The target  consisted  of  two  similar gas cells 1.5  M0470  1   17 
            inches in diameter by  2  inches  in  length,  which  M0470  1   18 
            could  be  moved  in  and  out of the beam by remote  M0470  1   19 
            control.  One cell was fitted with  a  0.00025  inch  M0470  1   20 
            havar  window  at  90 degrees t0 the beam and filled  M0470  1   21 
            with 3 atm of H-2.  The other cell had mylar windows  M0470  1   22 
            of  either 0.00014 or 0.00050 inches filled with 0.5  M0470  1   23 
            and 1.33 atm,  respectively,  of He-3. Both the He-2  M0470  1   24 
            and He-3 gases were to be better than 99.5% pure.     M0470  1   25 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SOLST) A  number  of  silicon  detectors  with  M0470  1   26 
            depletion depths ranging from 0.045 to 3.0 mm placed  M0470  1   27 
            in focal plane of a quadrupole-triplet magnet.        M0470  1   28 
ANALYSIS   The deuteron  energy  spectra  were measured for some  M0470  1   29 
            runs.  The total number  of  deuteron  counts  in  a  M0470  1   30 
            spectrum   peak   at  each  run  was  determined  by  M0470  1   31 
            substracting the background obtained in a  run  with  M0470  1   32 
            an  evacuated  target cell and the quadrupole magnet  M0470  1   33 
            at a similar field  setting.  The  total  number  of  M0470  1   34 
            deuteron  counts  from  He-3  contained  in  a  peak  M0470  1   35 
            together  with the total  number  of  proton  counts  M0470  1   36 
            from  He-2  contained in a peak produced by the same  M0470  1   37 
            gamma  energy  and  with  the  Deswart  and  Marshak  M0470  1   38 
            theoretical  cross section d-sig/d-omega (H-2) at 90  M0470  1   39

COMMENT    The He-3(g,d)p  differential  cross  section  at   90  M0470  1   46 
            degrees  in  the laboratory system has been measured  M0470  1   47 
            in the gamma-ray energy range of 8.5 to  46  MeV.  A  M0470  1   48 
            broad  peak  with a maximum of 93 microbarn/sr at 11  M0470  1   49 
            mev  is  observed.  The  He-3(g,2p)n  proton  energy  M0470  1   50 
            spectrum  produced by 40 MeV bremsstrahlung has also  M0470  1   51 
            been measured.  A survey of sum-rule predictions  is  M0470  1   52 
            also included.                                        M0470  1   53
