METHOD     (EXTB,PHD) The  energy  separation of the protons and  M047000100010 
            deuterons  from  He-3  was  achieved  by  pulseshape  M047000100011 
            discrimination.   Number  of  silicon detectors with  M047000100012 
            depletion depths ranging from 0.045 to 3.0  mm  were  M047000100013 
            used  either  singly  or  in  combinations of two to  M047000100014 
            separate protons and deuterons from  the  background  M047000100015 
            due to electrons and neutrons.                        M047000100016 
SAMPLE     The target  consisted  of  two  similar gas cells 1.5  M047000100017 
            inches in diameter by  2  inches  in  length,  which  M047000100018 
            could  be  moved  in  and  out of the beam by remote  M047000100019 
            control.  One cell was fitted with  a  0.00025  inch  M047000100020 
            havar  window  at  90 degrees t0 the beam and filled  M047000100021 
            with 3 atm of H-2.  The other cell had mylar windows  M047000100022 
            of  either 0.00014 or 0.00050 inches filled with 0.5  M047000100023 
            and 1.33 atm,  respectively,  of He-3. Both the He-2  M047000100024 
            and He-3 gases were to be better than 99.5% pure.     M047000100025

DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SOLST) A  number  of  silicon  detectors  with  M047000100028 
            depletion depths ranging from 0.045 to 3.0 mm placed  M047000100029 
            in focal plane of a quadrupole-triplet magnet.        M047000100030 
ANALYSIS   The deuteron  energy  spectra  were measured for some  M047000100031 
            runs.  The total number  of  deuteron  counts  in  a  M047000100032 
            spectrum   peak   at  each  run  was  determined  by  M047000100033 
            substracting the background obtained in a  run  with  M047000100034 
            an  evacuated  target cell and the quadrupole magnet  M047000100035 
            at a similar field  setting.  The  total  number  of  M047000100036 
            deuteron  counts  from  He-3  contained  in  a  peak  M047000100037 
            together  with the total  number  of  proton  counts  M047000100038 
            from  He-2  contained in a peak produced by the same  M047000100039

COMMENT    The He-3(g,d)p  differential  cross  section  at   90  M047000100048 
            degrees  in  the laboratory system has been measured  M047000100049 
            in the gamma-ray energy range of 8.5 to  46  MeV.  A  M047000100050 
            broad  peak  with a maximum of 93 microbarn/sr at 11  M047000100051 
            mev  is  observed.  The  He-3(g,2p)n  proton  energy  M047000100052 
            spectrum  produced by 40 MeV bremsstrahlung has also  M047000100053 
            been measured.  A survey of sum-rule predictions  is  M047000100054 
            also included.                                        M047000100055
