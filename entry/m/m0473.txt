METHOD     (ACTIV) Measuring  the  activity induced in  Cu-63 by  M047300100008 
            electrodisintegration.                                M047300100009 
SAMPLE     The  target  consisted  of  99%  enriched Cu-63 foils  M047300100010 
            approximately 5 mg/cm**2 in NIS experiments  and  of  M047300100011 
            99.9%  enriched  Cu-63  foils 10.0 (0.2) mg/cm**2 in  M047300100012 
            USP experiments.                                      M047300100013 
PART-DET   (B+)                                                   M047300100014 
ANALYSIS   The data from induced activity were acquired in  five  M047300100015 
            sequential four minute counting periods.  After each  M047300100016 
            counting  period,  the  511  keV  annihilation  peak  M047300100017 
            counting rate was determined and corrected for decay  M047300100018 
            to the end of the irradiation and for  decay  within  M047300100019 
            the  counting period.  Then numbers of counting were  M047300100020 
            used  to  obtain  the  electrodisintegration   cross  M047300100021 
            section.  The  USP  relative data were normalized to  M047300100022 
            the     NIST     absolute     measurements.      The  M047300100023 
            photodisintegration  cross section was obtained from  M047300100024 
            electrodisintegration  cross   section   using   the  M047300100025 
            virtual photon spectra theory.                        M047300100026 
CORRECTION The measured  counting rates were corrected for decay  M047300100027 
            to the end of the irradiation and for  decay  within  M047300100028 
            the  each of used counting four minutes period.  The  M047300100029 
            experimental electrodisintegration cross section was  M047300100030 
            corrected   for   the   contribution   due   to  the  M047300100031 
            bremsstrahlung generated in the target.  The virtual  M047300100032 
            photon  spectra  were  corrected  for  nuclear  size  M047300100033 
            effects.                                              M047300100034

COMMENT    The bremsstrahlung  cross section has been studied by  M047300100042 
            measuring the (b+)  activity  induced  in  Cu-63  by  M047300100043 
            electrodisintegration and when thin radiators of Cu,  M047300100044 
            Mo, Ta, and Th were placed in the electron beam just  M047300100045 
            ahead  of  the  target.  The  electron energies were  M047300100046 
            varied from 13.5 to  60  MeV  for  the  reaction of   M047300100047 
            electrodisintegration  and from 20 to 60 MeV for the  M047300100048 
            radiator-in measurements;  the (g,n)  cross  section  M047300100049 
            for   Cu-63  was  determined  using  virtual  photon  M047300100050 
            theory;  the radiator data were fitted using various  M047300100051 
            data on bremsstrahlung cross sections.                M047300100052
