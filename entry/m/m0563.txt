DETECTOR   (SI) Si detector with an area of 2000 mm2 and a        M0563  1   15 
            thickness of 300 mu-m was used. In the case of the    M0563  1   16 
            forward 15 MeV measurement, a thicker detector        M0563  1   17 
            (2 mm/1250 mm2) was mounted.                          M0563  1   18 
           (SIBAR) The energy calibration of the surface barrier  M0563  1   19 
            detector was performed with the help of a Th-228      M0563  1   20 
            alpha-source, yielding peaks with energies between    M0563  1   21

SAMPLE     The targets were deuterated polyethylene foils: a      M0563  1   23 
            CD-2 foil has a weight of 4.88 (0.09)mg/cm**2, a      M0563  1   24

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) Statistical errors. For the extreme angles,    M0563  1   26 
            the statistical error on the results amounts 4-5% (at M0563  1   27 
            0 degr.) and 7-8 % (180 degr.), respectively,         M0563  1   28 
            while the systematic uncertainty was at most 3 %.     M0563  1   29 
           (ERR-SYS) Systematic uncertainties were estimated      M0563  1   30 
            to be not more than 3% for the following sources:     M0563  1   31 
            - bremsstrahlung shape;                               M0563  1   32 
            - beam monitoring;                                    M0563  1   33 
            - target thickness;                                   M0563  1   34

COMMENT    The 0, and 180 degree, as well as the 90 degree        M0563  1   37 
            differential cross sections for the 2H(gamma,p)n      M0563  1   38 
            reaction have been measured at lab photon energies    M0563  1   39 
            between 7 and 19 MeV. Special attention was paid to   M0563  1   40 
            the accuracy, in particular by measuring the forward  M0563  1   41 
            Compton electron yield. The data confirm the          M0563  1   42 
            existence of a minimum in the forward cross section   M0563  1   43 
            and indicate beyond any doubt that the fore/aft ratio M0563  1   44 
            is larger than unity. Comparison shows reasonable     M0563  1   45 
            agreement with the results from recent "conventional" M0563  1   46 
            theoretical approaches, including meason exchange and M0563  1   47 
            relativistic corrections, although the description of M0563  1   48 
            the C-coefficient, appearing in the Partovi expansion M0563  1   49 
            of the differential cross section, remains            M0563  1   50 
            unsatisfactory. A possible source for this            M0563  1   51 
            discrepancy could be the inadequate description of    M0563  1   52 
            the E1 and/or the E2 transition operator.             M0563  1   53
