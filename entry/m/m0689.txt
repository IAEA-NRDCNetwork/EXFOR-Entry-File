            purity) of  physical  thickness  ~  2.5  mm   (562.5  M068900100016

COMMENT    Relative population  of  states  in 11B following the  M068900100037 
            12C(g,p)11B reaction have been  measured  with  high  M068900100038 
            resolution using 70 % HpGe gamma-detector to observe  M068900100039 
            decay  gamma-rays  from  the  residual  nucleus. The  M068900100040 
            triplet of states near 7 MeV in 11B are resolved and  M068900100041 
            measured populations compared to previous data.  The  M068900100042 
            analysis includes a  consideration  of  gamma-proton  M068900100043 
            angular correlations,  which was  not  made  in  the  M068900100044 
            previous  measurement.  The new and previous results  M068900100045 
            corrected  for  angular  correlation  effects  agree  M068900100046 
            reasonably  well  with calculatons that include one-  M068900100047 
            and two-body nuclear currents,  pion  exchange,  and  M068900100048 
            DELTA   currents,  under  the  assumption  that  the  M068900100049 
            photons are mainly absorbed on exchanged pions.       M068900100050
