ANALYSIS   Each of the events  includes two charged particles and M038400100020 
            one neutral particle.  The events were analyzed on an M038400100021 
            event-by-event basis to obtain the  momentum  vectors M038400100022 
            and masses  of  the  particles.  The missing mass and M038400100023 
            momentum on the nppx-type event,  where x  represents M038400100024 
            an unobserved  particle,  were calculated from the Eg M038400100025 
            and the reconstructed four-momentum of  the  detected M038400100026 
            particles.  When the missing mass was consistent with M038400100027 
            a neutron,  the event  was  classified  as  the  nnpp M038400100028 
            channel  and  the  missing momentum was attributed to M038400100029 
            the neutron.                                          M038400100030

COMMENT    This is the  first  measurement  of  the  total  cross M038400100032 
            section of  the  He-4(g,npp)n  reaction in the energy M038400100033 
            range of 135 -  455  MeV.  The  cross  section  which M038400100034 
            cannot  be  reproduced  by  any   model,  has similar M038400100035 
            Eg-dependence to cross section of the process  (He-4) M038400100036 
            + g  ->  all  channels.  The  average  ratio of cross M038400100037 
            sections of two kinds mentioned  above  is  equal  to M038400100038 
            2.3 (0.3) %   and  is  compared  with   cascade-model M038400100039 
            calculation in  which  quasi-free   pion   production M038400100040 
            followed by pion reabsorption is assumed.             M038400100041
