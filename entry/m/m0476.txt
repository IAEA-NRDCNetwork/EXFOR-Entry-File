ANALYSIS   For each run characterized by a given set of           M047600100028 
            kinematical conditions two-dimensional histograms     M047600100029 
            for the energy losses in the spectrometer detectors   M047600100030 
            were established and protons (and electrons and       M047600100031 
            pions also) was clear-cut identified.                 M047600100032 
CORRECTION The corrections were made for:                         M047600100033 
           - proton absorption in the copper absorber situated    M047600100034 
             in front of the telescope (this correction never     M047600100035 
             exceeded 15%);                                       M047600100036 
           - counting losses due to the high counting rate in     M047600100037 
             the telescope scintillators (this correction was     M047600100038 
             estimated to be 2 - 8%);                             M047600100039 
           - events originating in the target walls (this         M047600100040 
             correction was estimated to be about 1.5%).          M047600100041 
COMMENT    Differential cross sections for the reactions          M047600100042 
            He-3(g,p)d and He-4(g,p)t were measured at proton     M047600100043 
            c.m. angles of 60 and 90 degrees for photon           M047600100044 
            energies ranging from 150 to 450 mev with an          M047600100045 
            average resolution of 8 MeV. Deuterons and tritons    M047600100046 
            were analyzed in a magnetic spectrometer whereas      M047600100047 
            coincident protons were detected in a plastic         M047600100048 
            scintillator telescope. The He-3 and He-4 two-body    M047600100049 
            photodisintegration differential cross sections show  M047600100050 
            a monotonically decreasing variation with photon      M047600100051 
            energy. In addition, partial data on the differential M047600100052 
            cross section of the reaction He-4(g,n)He-3 at 90     M047600100053 
            and 120 degrees of neutron c.m. angle are given.     MM047600100054
