SAMPLE     In the B-11 experiment  a  sample  of  natural  boron  M036200100013 
            (80.39% B-11,19.61% B-10) of 11.04 g/sm**2 thickness  M036200100014 
            was used.  For B-10 measurements the enriched target  M036200100015 
            (90.4 % B-10, 9.6% B-11) had thickness 5.69 g/sm**2.  M036200100016 
ANALYSIS   A high efficiency neutron  detector  enables  one  to  M036200100017 
            measure the photoneutron multiplicities directly. It  M036200100018 
            then follows that the (g,xn) cross sections  can  be  M036200100019 
            obtained   separately   by   means   of  statistical  M036200100020 
            considerations. The moments method which was further  M036200100021 
            developed  by Krueger was used.  in order to measure  M036200100022 
            absolute cross sections the photon flux,  the photon  M036200100023 
            energy  and  the  efficiency of the neutron detector  M036200100024 
            have been calibrated.                                 M036200100025 
ERR-ANALYS The statistical errors only. The absolute calibration  M036200100026 
            error of the photon flux causes a  systematic  error  M036200100027 
            of the measured cross sections of about 10%.          M036200100028

COMMENT    Absolute (g,xn) cross sections for B-10 and B-11 were  M036200100034 
            measured  up  to  35  MeV  using  quasimonoenergetic  M036200100035 
            photon beam from positron  annihilation  in  flight.  M036200100036 
            The  experimental  cross sections were compared with  M036200100037 
            many-particle shell-model calculations and data from  M036200100038 
            previous   bremsstrahlung   experiments.   The  B-11  M036200100039 
            photoneutron cross section is discussed with respect  M036200100040 
            to  the  possible  isospin  splitting.  A systematic  M036200100041 
            review of the  photoneutron  cross  section  of  the  M036200100042 
            p-shell  nuclei  integrated up to about 30 MeV seems  M036200100043 
            to show a  strong  influence  of  the  alpha-cluster  M036200100044 
            structure of the target nuclei.                       M036200100045
