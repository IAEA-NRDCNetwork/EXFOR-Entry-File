            electrons circulating in storage ring.                M0405  1   13 
SAMPLE     The target  was  a very thin (0.16 mm) aluminium tube  M0405  1   14 
            (15 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter),  with  two  M0405  1   15 
            lexan and caps filled with deuterium or hydrogen (in  M0405  1   16 
            turn) at high pressure (30 atm).                      M0405  1   17

ANALYSIS   Direct measurement of  the  reaction  cross  section.  M0405  1   21 
            Data were taken in several runs for effective photon  M0405  1   22 
            mean energies eg = 14.7,  19.3,  28.9,  38.2,  47.5,  M0405  1   23 
            57.5,  and 74.0 MeV, with deuterium and hydrogen gas  M0405  1   24 
            (for background measurements)  in  turn  as  target.  M0405  1   25 
            data   were   also   taken   with   use   only   the  M0405  1   26 
            bremsstrahlung component of the beam.                 M0405  1   27 
CORRECTION Corrections were   made   for   the  proton  detector  M0405  1   28

COMMENT    The total cross section  for  photodisintegration  of  M0405  1   33 
            deuteron has been measured in the g-ray energy range  M0405  1   34 
            between 15 and 75 MeV,  by use of  the  monocromatic  M0405  1   35 
            LADON photon beam and detection of the protons.       M0405  1   36
