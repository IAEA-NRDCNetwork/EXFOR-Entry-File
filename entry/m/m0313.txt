DETECTOR   (PLATE) 200 mum thick Ilford C-2 emulsion. The  plane  M0313  1   12 
            of  each  emulsion was vertical and made an angle of  M0313  1   13 
            5.degr.  to the line  joining  the  centres  of  the  M0313  1   14 
            target and the emulsion.  Lead shields 0.32 cm thick  M0313  1   15 
            were placed over each emulsion to screen it from low  M0313  1   16 
            energy photons from the target.                       M0313  1   17

            (a) the shrinkage of the emulsion,                    M0313  1   19 
            (b)  the tracks which leave the emulsion,             M0313  1   20 
            (c) the  attenuation  of neutrons in the gold target  M0313  1   21 
            and the lead shield round the emulsion,               M0313  1   22 
            (d) the   variation  of  the  n-p  scattering  cross  M0313  1   23 
                section with neutron energy.                      M0313  1   24

           (ERR-1) The error involved in  normalising  the  fast  M0313  1   26

ADD-RES    (COMP) The experimental spectrum is compared with the  M0313  1   28 
            energy distribution calculated on the basis  of  the  M0313  1   29 
            evaporation model.                                    M0313  1   30 
           A  new method for the calculation of the  corrections  M0313  1   31 
            involved  for  those  proton recoils which leave the  M0313  1   32 
            emulsion is presented.                                M0313  1   33 
COMMENT    The spectrum shows two peaks.  The large peak at 1.25  M0313  1   34 
            MeV can be interpreted as  due  to  the  statistical  M0313  1   35 
            decay  of  the compound nucleus. The smaller peak at  M0313  1   36 
            about 5.5 MeV is  assumed  to  came  from  a  direct  M0313  1   37 
            transition, as described by the Wilkinson model.      M0313  1   38

ANALYSIS   For neutron energies greater than about 5 MeV this is  M0313  4    4 
            simple  to   obtain  from  the   data,   since   the  M0313  4    5 
            contribution  by  the  evaporated  neutrons  to  the  M0313  4    6 
            spectrum  is small  at high energies.  The situation  M0313  4    7 
            for  En < 5 MeV  is much  more difficult to resolve,  M0313  4    8 
            however,  since  the fraction  of the neutrons which  M0313  4    9 
            are produced  by the direct  process is  not  known.  M0313  4   10 
            Also,  the shape of the statistical spectrum  may be  M0313  4   11 
            in error,  even  though  it  appears to fit  the low  M0313  4   12 
            energy data well.  Nevertheless, if this spectrum is  M0313  4   13 
            assumed to be correct, then 20 % of the neutrons are  M0313  4   14 
            found to be produced by a direct process.             M0313  4   15
