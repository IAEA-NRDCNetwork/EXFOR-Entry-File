COMMENT    THE PHOTOFISSION CROSS SECTION OF U-238 INDUCED BY     M040700100028 
           MONOCROMATIC AND POLARIZED PHOTONS HAS BEEN MEASURED   M040700100029 
           USING THE LADON FACILITY. THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN      M040700100030 
           PERFORMED AT SIX DIFFERENT ENERGIES IN THE RANGE       M040700100031 
           46 - 72 MEV BY DETECTING THE FISSION FRAGMENTS         M040700100032 
           EITHER IN URANIUM-LOADED NUCLEAR-TRACK EMULSION        M040700100033 
           PLATES OR IN URANIUM-MICA SANDWICHES.                  M040700100034 
           DURING THE EXPERIMENT THE MAIN FEATURES OF LADON       M040700100035 
           BEAM WERE A SATISFACTORY ENERGY RESOLUTION (UP TO      M040700100036 
           ABOUT 10% FWHM, AT MAXIMUM ENERGY), AN EXTREMLY        M040700100037 
           LOW BREMSSTRAHLUNG BACKGROUND (ABOUT 5% INTEGRATED     M040700100038 
           OVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM ABOVE 2 MEV), AN INTENSITY     M040700100039 
           OF ABOUT 10**5 PHOTONS/S, AND AN ALMOST COMPLETE       M040700100040
