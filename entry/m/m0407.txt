            identification and counting  of  fission  fragments,  M0407  1   21 
            and track analysis were carried out by using optical  M0407  1   22 
            microscopes.  The emulsions were processed using the  M0407  1   23 
            special  technique  to  obtain  very legible fission  M0407  1   24 
            tracks in spite of background from alphaparticles.    M0407  1   25

COMMENT    The photofission cross section of  U-238  induced  by  M0407  1   27 
            monocromatic and polarized photons has been measured  M0407  1   28 
            using the ladon facility.  The experiment  has  been  M0407  1   29 
            performed  at six different energies in the range 46  M0407  1   30 
            - 72 MeV by detecting the fission  fragments  either  M0407  1   31 
            in  uranium-loaded  nuclear-track emulsion plates or  M0407  1   32 
            in uranium-mica sandwiches.  During  the  experiment  M0407  1   33 
            the  main features of ladon beam were a satisfactory  M0407  1   34 
            energy resolution (up to about 10%  fwhm, at maximum  M0407  1   35 
            energy), an  extremely low bremsstrahlung background  M0407  1   36 
            (about 5% integrated over the whole spectrum above 2  M0407  1   37 
            MeV),  an intensity of about 10**5 photons/s, and an  M0407  1   38 
            almost complete linear polarization.                  M0407  1   39
