COMMENT    The forward 2H(gamma,p)n cross section was measured at M0566  1   25 
            7.2 and 8.5 MeV photon energy. The new absolute valuesM0566  1   26 
            confirm the theoretically predicted presence of a     M0566  1   27 
            minimum in this cross section. A discrimination was   M0566  1   28 
            made between the results from various theoretical     M0566  1   29 
            descriptions.                                         M0566  1   30
