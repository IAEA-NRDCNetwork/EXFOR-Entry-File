            mg/cm**2 thin films of Th-232 - O-2,  U-nat.  - O-3,  M0387  1   15

            mica sheets as supports and were contacted with  100  M0387  1   17 
            micron thick Makrofol N,  Bayer AG,  which served as  M0387  1   18

            effective  numbers  of  target  nuclei for different  M0387  1   20 
            stacks were 3.4, 8.1, and 1.9 units of 10**18 cm**-2  M0387  1   21

CORRECTION To obtain the final values of the physical quantities  M0387  1   27 
            and associated errors, the data have been treated by  M0387  1   28 
            considering the geometry  of  exposure,  statistics,  M0387  1   29 
            counting    and   registration   efficiencies,   and  M0387  1   30

COMMENT    Experimental fissility   data    from    photofission  M0387  1   32 
            reactions of Th-232,  U-238,  and U-235 muclei at 52  M0387  1   33 
            MeV have been obtained using monochromatic and fully  M0387  1   34 
            polarized  photon beams and dielectric fission-track  M0387  1   35 
            detectors.  These data,  along with literature  data  M0387  1   36 
            for Np-237,  U-235,238,  Th-232, Bi-209, Pb-208, and  M0387  1   37 
            Yb-174  nuclei  have  been   analyzed   within   the  M0387  1   38 
            framework   of   a   simple   two-step   model   for  M0387  1   39 
            photofission  reactions,  i.e.,  absorption  of  the  M0387  1   40 
            incident  photon by a neutron - proton pair followed  M0387  1   41 
            by an evaporation-fission competition mechanism  for  M0387  1   42 
            excited  nucleus.  For  nuclei in the ta - np region  M0387  1   43 
            the trend of calculated  fissilities  clearly  shows  M0387  1   44 
            shell effects in the vicinity of Pb-208. In the case  M0387  1   45 
            of  U-238  the  effect  of  photon  polarization  on  M0387  1   46 
            fission   direction   has  also  been  studied,  and  M0387  1   47 
            isotropy was  observed  in  the  fragment  azimuthal  M0387  1   48 
            distribution.                                         M0387  1   49
