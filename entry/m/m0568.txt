COMMENT    Nuclear emulsion plates Ilford-K0 exposed to (1.0 -    M0568  1   20 
           5.5) GeV bremsstrahlung beams in order to study        M0568  1   21 
           photoinduced break-up of Ar, Br nuclei have been       M0568  1   22 
           processed to produce visible fission tracks for track  M0568  1   23 
           analysis with optical microscope. Track-length         M0568  1   24 
           distributions, angular distributions and angular       M0568  1   25 
           correlations of the produced fragments obtained at     M0568  1   26 
           six end-point bremsstrahlung energies are presented    M0568  1   27 
           and discussed. The analysis of the data shows that     M0568  1   28 
           the recorded events are produced by two different      M0568  1   29 
           reaction mechanisms, namely fission and fragmentation. M0568  1   30

           fragmentation, binary and ternary fission of Ag, Br    M0568  1   32 
           targets in the energy range investigated have been     M0568  1   33 
           measured. Absolute mean cross sections per photon and  M0568  1   34 
           corresponding fissilities have been evaluated for      M0568  1   35 
           binary fission of Ag and Br and compared with          M0568  1   36
