METHOD     (MAGFR) The  photoprotons  are magnetically deflected  M045500100010 
            out of the photon beam and focused onto a detector.   M045500100011 
SAMPLE     The deuterated  target  consisted  of  a stack of two  M045500100012 
            pieces of deuterated polyethylene  foil,  the  total  M045500100013 
            thickness  of which was determined to be 9.76 (0.18)  M045500100014 
            mg/cm**2.  The components,  given by percentages  in  M045500100015 
            weight,  are:  75.54%  for C-12, 23.73% for H-2, and  M045500100016 
            0.73%  for H-1.  The concentrations for  oxygen  and  M045500100017 
            nitrogen were found to be below 0.5%.                 M045500100018

DETECTOR   (SOLST) The   detector   is   circular,   ruggedized,  M045500100020 
            partially depleted surface-barrier detector  with  a  M045500100021 
            sensitive  area  of 2000 mm**2 and a depletion depth  M045500100022 
            of about 300 mu.  This detector was cooled to  about  M045500100023 
            200 degrees k by the use of liquid nitrogen.          M045500100024 
ANALYSIS   Using the same deuterated  target,  the  same  magnet  M045500100025 
            system  and the same detector,  the yield of compton  M045500100026 
            electrons was measured that were  emitted  into  the  M045500100027 
            same  solid  angle  as  the photoprotons.  Since the  M045500100028 
            compton cross section is well  known,  the  rate  of  M045500100029 
            photoprotons  in  terms  of the incident photon flux  M045500100030 
            can be calculated accurately and is  independent  of  M045500100031 
            the  properties of the beam monitor and the shape of  M045500100032 
            the bremsstrahlung if the  spectrometer  is  set  in  M045500100033 
            both  measurements to the same primary photon energy  M045500100034 
            bin.                                                  M045500100035

COMMENT    The absolute  differential  cross  section  for   the  M045500100037 
            photodisintegration of the deuteron at 0-degrees for  M045500100038 
            the outgoing proton has been measured at  10.74  MeV  M045500100039 
            lab  photon  energy  using  bremsstrahlung  beam,  a  M045500100040 
            deuterated  target,   a   magnet   system,   and   a  M045500100041 
            surfacebarrier detector.  The absolute cross section  M045500100042 
            was determined with an angular distribution of  1.25  M045500100043 
            degrees.  The  result,  pertaining to a 4.6 MeV wide  M045500100044 
            photon energy interval,  favours a  minimum  in  the  M045500100045 
            differential  cross  section  around  10  MeV photon  M045500100046 
            energy.                                               M045500100047
