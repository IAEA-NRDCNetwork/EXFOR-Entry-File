ANALYSIS   Because the reactions (gamma,p) and (gamma,2p2n) were nM048600100016 
           differentiated in visual scanning of the photographs   M048600100017 
           identification of these events was accomplished        M048600100018 
           after measurement of the curvature of the tracks.      M048600100019 
           The criteria for identification of proton and          M048600100020 
           deuteron tracks were: the track density, its change    M048600100021 
           along the track, scattering of the particles at the    M048600100022 
           end of the range, the number of gaps, and the number   M048600100023 
           of delta-electrons per unit length of track.           M048600100024 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors are presented only.     M048600100025 
           Errors associated with measurement of the absolute     M048600100026 
           intensity of the radiation from the synchrotron        M048600100027 
           were estimated to be not larger than 6%.               M048600100028 
CORRECTION Since two neutrons are emitted in the reaction         M048600100029 
           studied, application of the conservation laws does     M048600100030 
           not enable determination uniquely the energy of the    M048600100031 
           photon which produced the reaction. However, it can    M048600100032 
           be estimated qualitatively if the energies of the      M048600100033 
           neutrons and protons emitted in the reaction were      M048600100034 
           assumed to be the same on the average. Since the       M048600100035 
           curvature measurements were done for events in which   M048600100036 
           the angle of inclination of the proton tracks to a     M048600100037 
           plane perpendicular to the magnetic field does not     M048600100038 
           exceed 30 degrees, an appropriate geometrical          M048600100039 
           correction was made.                                   M048600100040 
COMMENT    A cloud chamber in a magnetic field has been used to   M048600100041 
           measure the cross section for the He-4(gamma,2p2n)     M048600100042 
           reaction in the gamma-quanta energy range from 20 to   M048600100043
