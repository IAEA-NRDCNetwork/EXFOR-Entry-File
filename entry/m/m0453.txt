METHOD     (EXTB,SITA) Absorption method.  The photons  obtained  M0453  1    9 
            from  thermal  neutron  capture reaction were passed  M0453  1   10 
            through 2-m long absorbers (natural water (H-2)O and  M0453  1   11 
            heavy water (D-2)O).                                  M0453  1   12 
SAMPLE     Two water absorbers were contained in stainless steel  M0453  1   13 
            tubes  of  equal  internal  dimensions  (4.2 cm) and  M0453  1   14 
            different lengths:  199.3 cm  (filled  with  (H-2)O,  M0453  1   15 
            density 0.99841 g/cm**2) and 199.967 cm (filled with  M0453  1   16 
            (D-2)O, density 1.10549 g/cm**2).                     M0453  1   17

ANALYSIS   After measurement  of  the  transmitted g-spectra the  M0453  1   20 
            photodisintegration cross section was obtained  from  M0453  1   21

            through the two absorbers.                            M0453  1   23

CORRECTION Corrections were  applied  for the decay of the Na-24  M0453  1   27 
            source due to the time lapse between  two  alternate  M0453  1   28 
            absorbers and also for the temperature change in the  M0453  1   29 
            absorbers.                                            M0453  1   30

COMMENT    The absolute cross section of the photodisintegration  M0453  1   32 
            of  deuterium  was  measured  at  2754  keV using an  M0453  1   33 
            absorptive method by  passing  the  photons  through  M0453  1   34 
            2-m long absorbers of (H-2)O and (D-2)O.              M0453  1   35
