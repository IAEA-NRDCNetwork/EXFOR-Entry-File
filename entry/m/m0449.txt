ANALYSIS   The photofission  cross  section  sig(g,f)  at photon  M0449  1   18 
            energy Eg is related to the fission fragments counts  M0449  1   19

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The  errors  are  given  include  counting  M0449  1   21 
            errors,  errors  in  efficiency  calibration  of the  M0449  1   22 
            g-ray and fission fragment detectors,  uncertainties  M0449  1   23 
            in the angular distribution of the fission fragments  M0449  1   24 
            and g-rays,  and uncertainties in the  alignment  of  M0449  1   25 
            the  thorium  foils and kimfol films relative to the  M0449  1   26 
            proton target.                                        M0449  1   27 
CORRECTION The cross   sections   given   were   corrected   for  M0449  1   28 
            contributions  caused  by  the  unwanted  gamma-rays  M0449  1   29 
            emitted  from some (p,g) resonances.  Except for one  M0449  1   30 
            case,  these corrections did not exceed 10%  of  the  M0449  1   31 
            presented  values.  The  sum of the corrections from  M0449  1   32 
            fission caused by neutrons from (g,n),  (g,2n),  and  M0449  1   33 
            fission,  as well as contribution from (g,nf),  were  M0449  1   34 
            estimated to be smoller than 2%.                      M0449  1   35 
COMMENT    The photofission cross section of Th-232 was measured  M0449  1   36 
            in the 5.8 - 12.0 MeV energy range with  an  average  M0449  1   37 
            photon  energy  resolution  of 600 eV.  Intermediate  M0449  1   38 
            structure was observed at 5.91, 5.97, and 6.31 MeV.   M0449  1   39
