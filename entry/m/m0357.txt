            spectrum   and   10   p.c.   to  study  the  angular  M035700100018

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S)  Statistical  errors  of   measurements.  The  M035700100030

COMMENT    An investigation  was  carried  out  of  the  angular  M035700100036 
            distribution of photoneutrons with energies above 10  M035700100037 
            MeV  emitted  by Be-9,  C-12 and Al-27 targets under  M035700100038 
            the  irradiation  by   88   MeV   end-point   energy  M035700100039 
            bremsstrahlung. The energy spectrum of photoneutrons  M035700100040 
            emitted at the angle of 75  degrees  from  C-12  was  M035700100041 
            also  investigated and from the data thus obtained a  M035700100042 
            comparison  is  made   of   the   photoneutron   and  M035700100043 
            photoproton yields in the same energy intervals. The  M035700100044 
            angular distribution results are compared  with  the  M035700100045 
            quasi-deutron   model   and   the  model  of  direct  M035700100046 
            resonance nuclear photoeffect. Qualitative agreement  M035700100047 
            with the quasi-deutron model has been obtained.       M035700100048

ANALYSIS   To determine the photoneutron spectrum the groups  of  M035700500005 
            proton  recoils  formed in the converter by neutrons  M035700500006 
            from 1 MeV-wide range around the mean energies  E(i)  M035700500007 
            were graphically found.  On the basis of such graphs  M035700500008 
            constructed for the neutrons energies E(i) with  the  M035700500009 
            step  of  1 MeV the number of recoil protons in each  M035700500010 
            energy interval may be  calculated  by  summing  the  M035700500011 
            number  of  neutrons  multiplied by some coefficient  M035700500012 
            over  all  possible  values  of  E(i).  The   energy  M035700500013 
            distribution  of  neutrons  which  took  place after  M035700500014 
            calculations  the   experimental   distribution   of  M035700500015 
            protons   was  regarded  as  the  real  photoneutron  M035700500016 
            spectrum.                                             M035700500017 
CORRECTION For (a)  the  thickness  of the converter and (b) the  M035700500018 
            cross section of (n,p)-scattering were made.          M035700500019 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No information.   The method   of   energy  M035700500020 
            spectrum  calculation  leads  to  appearance  of the  M035700500021 
            additional errors.  The  summary error was estimated  M035700500022 
            as 40 p.c.  (without the  statistical errors).        M035700500023
