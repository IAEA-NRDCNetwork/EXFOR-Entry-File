COMMENT    The forward scattering cross section at theta          M0585  1   15 
            about 1.0 and 1.7 degree of E = 4 - 10 MeV            M0585  1   16 
            monoenergetic photons from Pb and Bi targets has      M0585  1   17 
            been measured. The photon beam was obtained from      M0585  1   18 
            Fe(n,gamma) reaction. The elastic cross section at    M0585  1   19 
            such angles, being dominated by Rayleigh and          M0585  1   20 
            Delbruck scattering processes, was measured           M0585  1   21 
            relative to the Compton cross section. The fact       M0585  1   22 
            that one of the gamma-lines of Fe(n,gamma) reaction   M0585  1   23 
            happens to overlap the 7.28 MeV level in 208Pb,       M0585  1   24 
            yielding a strong nuclear resonance fluorescence      M0585  1   25 
            signal, enabled to observe, for the first time,       M0585  1   26 
            an interference effect with the scattering            M0585  1   27 
            amplitude for the specific case of the random         M0585  1   28 
            photoexcitation process is derived. The               M0585  1   29 
            interference effect of this latter process with       M0585  1   30 
            Rayleigh and Delbruck scattering was calculated       M0585  1   31 
            and an excellent agreement with measured values       M0585  1   32 
            was obtained.                                         M0585  1   33
