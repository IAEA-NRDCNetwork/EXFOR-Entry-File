           Thicknesses 100, 250 and 500 Microgram/Cm**2. Calcium  B014000100010 
           Carbonate was Evaporated onto 0.5 mm Tantalum Backings.B014000100011 
           A 20 Microgram/Cm**2 Layer of Gold was Deposited on    B014000100012

           For Counting a 0.5 mm Thick Tantalum Square was Placed B014000100015 
           Over the Target to Stop All Emitted Positrons.         B014000100016 
           The Efficiency of the Detector System was Determined   B014000100017 
           By Comparison with a Calibrated Ge-68 Source in Equal  B014000100018 
           Geometry.                                              B014000100019

           The Targets were Irradiated For 100 Min and Counted    B014000100021 
           For 200-300 Min. The Proton Beam Current was           B014000100022 
           50 Nanoampere, Typically.                              B014000100023 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) For Each Irradiation a Decay Curve was         B014000100024 
           Measured, from Which the 3.89 Hr Sc-43 Activity Could  B014000100025 
           Be Extracted by a Least Squares Fitting Procedure.     B014000100026

           110 MIN) Could be Distinguished.  The Latter Activity  B014000100029 
           Was the More Serious Because of Its Relatively Long    B014000100030 
           Half-Life, Low Q-Value, and the Oxide Nature of the    B014000100031

           Impurities in the Target the Measured Cross Section    B014000100034 
           Values were Corrected Above 3 MeV and 4.5 MeV For      B014000100035

           For this Measured Cross Section Values have Been  Used.B014000100037 
           Furthermore a Correction was Applied to Account For theB014000100038 
           Loss of Annihilation Coincidences Due to Summing of an B014000100039 
           Annihilation Quantum with a True Coincident Gamma-Ray, B014000100040 
           If Beta-Decay Feeds Excited States.  This Correction   B014000100041 
           Was 2.1% For Sc-43 Produced by Ca-42(P,GAMMA) And      B014000100042 
           Ca-43(P,N), and 8.6% For Sc-44 Produced by the         B014000100043
