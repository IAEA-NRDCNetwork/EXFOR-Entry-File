           Obviously not Corrected For 100% Abundance of Te-124,  B009000300015 
           Since a Comparison with the Other Target of Different  B009000300016

           Deviations from the Results with the Higher Enriched   B009000300018 
           Target are Probably Due to the Larger Amount of Other  B009000300019
