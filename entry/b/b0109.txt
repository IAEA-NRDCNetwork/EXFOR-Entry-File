ADD-RES    Saturation Production Rates in Microcurie/Microampere  B010901300022 
           Were Calculated on the Basis of the Cross Sections     B010901300023

FLAG       (1.) The Thick Target Yield Given is Too High Compared B010901300025 
           With the Saturation Production Rate of 3493 Microcurie/B010901300026 
           Microampere at 11.7 MeV Calculated by the Authors. The B010901300027 
           Correct Thick Target Yield Should be Lower Than this   B010901300028 
           Value. The Discrepancy to the Value Given is Due to theB010901300029 
           Fact That a Formula was Used Which is Valid Only For   B010901300030 
           Irradiation Times Short in Respect to the Half-Life    B010901300031

           (2.)This Value Supersedes Data Published Earlier by    B010901300033 
           The Authors (ISOTOPENPRAXIS,5,247,1969, SEE ALSO ENTRY B010901300034 
           B0084). The Difference to the Former Value is Probably B010901300035 
           Due to a Less Accurate Beam Current Determination.     B010901300036
