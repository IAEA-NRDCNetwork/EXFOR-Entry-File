           Longer Than the Collection Time of 1 Minute.           B010400300041 
SAMPLE    1Foil of Natrual Cu, Thickness 10 Micrometer. Al-Foils  B010400300042

          2Stack Containing Foils of Natural Cu of 5 Micrometer   B010400300044 
           Thickness Which were Mounted on Metal Frames. Al-Foils B010400300045 
           In Front of the Stack were Used to Degrade the         B010400300046 
           Incident Proton Energy of 52 MeV to the Desired Value. B010400300047

           The Ratio was Obviously Obtained from Separate Zn-61   B010400300055
