DETECTOR   (GLASD)Two Glass Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors   B015000100010 
           Were Used. The Detectors were Made of Soda Lime GlassesB015000100011 
           Having Uranium As an Impurity.                         B015000100012

           On the Surface of the Glass Detectors Plastic Energy   B015000100014

COMMENT    Above 28 MeV the Contribution to the Fission Cross     B015000100023 
           Section Could Come from Anyone or All of the Following B015000100024 
           Processes- U(HE-3,F), U(HE-3,NF), U(HE-3,PF) Or        B015000100025 
           U(HE-3,DF). This is Due to the Fact That Above the     B015000100026 
           Coulomb Barrier There is a Great Probability of Direct B015000100027 
           Interaction Between He-3 and Uranium.                  B015000100028
