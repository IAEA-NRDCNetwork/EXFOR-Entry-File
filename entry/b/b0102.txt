           The proton flux for the irradiation of target Ps2 was  B010200700037 
           determined by comparing the Ar-37 cross section for Cu B010200700038 
           and Fe to that obtained with target Ps1, both measured B010200700039

           than Al-27(p,3pn)Na-24 directly, due to the long       B010200700041
