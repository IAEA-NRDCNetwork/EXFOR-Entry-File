SAMPLE     Natural element, thickness about 1 mg/cm**2, evaporatedB009300100018 
           onto a Ta-backing thick enough to stop the proton beam.B009300100019 
COMMENT    No information is given, whether neutrons produced in  B009300100020 
           the thick target-backing did disturb and how they were B009300100021 
           corrected for.                                         B009300100022 
ERR-ANALYS 1. The cross sections given which are averages for     B009300100023 
           several repeated measurements are believed to be about B009300100024 
           15% accurate. Neutrons emitted from the targets        B009300100025 
           were measured with an instrumental error within about  B009300100026 
           10%. The proton current was monitored to about 2%      B009300100027 
           accuracy without giving details how this was done.     B009300100028 
           2. The energy spread of the beam within the target due B009300100029 
           to straggling and primary inhomogeneity was about      B009300100030 
           100 keV.                                               B009300100031 
CORRECTION No corrections for charged-particle emission were made,B009300100032 
           since in the present energy region between Q-value and B009300100033 
           Coulomb barrier neutron emission is strongly favoured  B009300100034 
           over charged particle emission.                        B009300100035
