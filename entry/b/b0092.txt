SAMPLE     Stacks consisting of high purity graphite sheets,      B0092  1    9 
           thickness 1 and/or 0.2 mm, containing less than 5 ppb  B0092  1   10 
           of natural boron. The number and the thickness of the  B0092  1   11 
           sheets used for an experiment depended on the energy   B0092  1   12 
           of the incident particles. Due to the small energy lossB0092  1   13 
           in the individual foils the stack was obviously not    B0092  1   14 
           used for energy degradation but rather for production  B0092  1   15 
           of several targets per run.                            B0092  1   16

           After irradiation one graphite sheet per analysis was  B0092  1   18 
           burnt on a small Au-disk on which most of spallation   B0092  1   19 
           products remained after total combustion. Combustion   B0092  1   20 
           was performed at temperatures below 700 centigrades,   B0092  1   21 
           where escape of volatile boron compounds was checked   B0092  1   22 
           to be small (less than 5% uncertainty in the cross     B0092  1   23 
           sections).                                             B0092  1   24 
           In all cases B-11/B-10 ratios were measured by means   B0092  1   25 
           of a mass separator. The boron ionization efficiency   B0092  1   26 
           relative to that of Be was strongly increased by       B0092  1   27 
           deposit of about 1 mg of high purity water on the      B0092  1   28

           Data were corrected for isotopic discrimination of the B0092  1   30

           Absolute B-11 cross sections were determined by means  B0092  3   24 
           of the isotope dilution method using an isotope        B0092  3   25 
           separator for implanting of a defined amount of B-11   B0092  3   26 
           into the irradiated targets. From the B-11/B-10 data   B0092  3   27 
           in these implanted targets and the separately measured B0092  3   28 
           cross section ratio the absolute B-11 cross section    B0092  3   29 
           was obtained after normalization to the known and      B0092  3   30 
           additionally measured Be-7 formation cross section and B0092  3   31 
           correction for the natural boron content.              B0092  3   32 
           It was experimentally tested that the differing depth  B0092  3   33 
           distributions for implanted (superficial layer) and    B0092  3   34 
           spallative (all depths) boron lead to equal extraction B0092  3   35 
           rates within 5%.                                       B0092  3   36

COMMENT    In the publication an energy region from 100 to        B0092  3   51 
           160 MeV is given. It is uncertain, whether or not this B0092  3   52 
           range reflects an energy degradation in the specific   B0092  3   53
