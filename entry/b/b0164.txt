COMMENT    Since Natural Nickel was Used As Target Material,      B016400200007 
           Zn-62 can be Produced by the Ni-61(A,3N) Reaction, T00.B016400200008 
           It was Assumed by the Author, That this Contribution   B016400200009 
           Is Very Low, Due to the Small Natural Abundance of     B016400200010 
           Ni-61 (1.19%) And the Relatively High Threshold of 26.5B016400200011
