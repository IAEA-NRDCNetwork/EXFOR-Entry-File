           The (17.6 +- 2 ) MeV Deuteron Beam was Degraded and    B017600100012 
           Scattered in a 1.3 Mg/Cm**2 Cu Foil. The Diffused Beam B017600100013 
           Was Required to Avoid Destroying of the Ni Window      B017600100014 
            (113 MG/CM**2) Of the Target-Assembly.The Beam CurrentB017600100015 
           Was Restricted to 25 Microampere to have Stable        B017600100016 
           Irradiation Conditions. By the Authors the Thickness   B017600100017 
           Of the Cu-Foil was Cited As 1.3 G/Cm**2 Instead of     B017600100018
