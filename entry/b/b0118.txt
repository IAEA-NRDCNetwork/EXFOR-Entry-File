           Since the heavy ion beam was not magnetically analyzed,B011800100011 
           the beam energies were measured with a gold            B011800100012 
           surface-barrier detector placed directly in the beam   B011800100013 
           path.                                                  B011800100014 
METHOD     (SITA,EXTB,BCINT,CHSEP)                                B011800100015 
           chemical separation of iodine was done within          B011800100016 
           10 minutes of the end of bombardment. The length       B011800100017 
           of bombardment was different for the used projectile   B011800100018 
           energies and lasted from 63 minutes to 212 minutes.    B011800100019 
           An silver-iodide/silver-bromide precipitate was        B011800100020 
           obtained and after filtering, both PRECPITATE and      B011800100021 
           filter paper were taped to a holder and placed in      B011800100022 
           front of a Ge(Li)-spectrometer.                        B011800100023 
           The U-layer was dissolved together with part of the    B011800100024 
           Al-backing plate to ensure dissolution of all of the   B011800100025 
           fission products.                                      B011800100026 
           The chemical yield was determined by neutron activationB011800100027 
           of I-127 in the samples and in a standard.             B011800100028 
           The samples were counted, starting approximately       B011800100029 
           10 minutes after the end of bombardment and            B011800100030 
           extending to 2 to 3 weeks thereafter.                  B011800100031 
           The average beam flux was 2.6*10**11 particles/sec.    B011800100032 
SAMPLE     Enriched U-238 targets, thickness 30 mg/cm**2.         B011800100033 
           U-238 was sputtered onto a 5 mm Al-backing plate.      B011800100034 
           a thin layer of 50-100 microgram/cm**2 Al was          B011800100035 
           evaporated onto the surface of the U-238 to prevent    B011800100036 
           oxidation. An effective target thickness was           B011800100037 
           calculated,using the tables of Northcliffe and         B011800100038 
           schilling, NUCL.DATA tables A7,233(1970), and          B011800100039 
           corresponds to the range of Ar-40 ions slowed down fromB011800100040

           90 keV and 2 MeV.                                      B011800100044

           the absolute efficiency for the counting geometry      B011800100046 
           was known with an accuracy of 5%.                      B011800100047 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The given uncertainties in the production   B011800100048 
           cross sections reflect the errors in the half-life fitsB011800100049 
           to the data.  They vary between 1% and 20% (comment  byB011800100050 
           the compiler of KACHAPAG).  Further information about  B011800100051

           2. The errors in beam energy were +-5 MeV, including   B011800100053 
           a possible energy shift of +-4 MeV and corrections     B011800100054 
           for energy loss in the Al-layer and energy defect      B011800100055 
           in the surface-barrier detector.                       B011800100056 
           The corrections to the beam energy consisted in        B011800100057 
           adding 1.0 to 1.5 MeV to the measured energies         B011800100058 
           which was less than the uncertainty in                 B011800100059 
           the beam energy.                                       B011800100060 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)The identification and assignment of a nuclide  B011800100061 
           was based on agreement of the energy, half-life and    B011800100062 
           relative abundance of the observed gamma-rays.         B011800100063 
           In order to calculate independent yields from the      B011800100064 
           measured partial cumulative ones it was concluded from B011800100065 
           the two-peaked isotopic distributions that the neutron B011800100066 
           excessive fission products originate from quasi-elasticB011800100067 
           transfer induced fission of uranium, while the neutron B011800100068 
           deficient and shielded products near the stability lineB011800100069 
           are due to complete fusion followed by fission of the  B011800100070 
           compound nucleus. Basing on this interpretation the    B011800100071 
           independent yield distribution was calculated by an    B011800100072 
           iterative procedure.                                   B011800100073 
CORRECTION The data were corrected for recoil losses from         B011800100074 
           the surface of the target corresponding to fission     B011800100075 
           fragments moving backward in the laboratory reference  B011800100076 
           frame. The recoil losses were calculated from          B011800100077 
           theoretical distributions of the products for the      B011800100078 
           different mechanisms involved and were then integrated B011800100079 
           over the effective target thickness, taking also into  B011800100080 
           account the decreasing bombarding energies.            B011800100081
