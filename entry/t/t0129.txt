METHOD     (REC)                                                  T0129  7   13 
          RStacked detector technique. Ratios were                T0129  7   14 
           measured using a detector stack of two different       T0129  7   15 
           thickness due to the fact that detection efficiency    T0129  7   16 
           varies with the minimum dip angle of the impinging     T0129  7   17 
           fission fragments. This minimum dip angle which        T0129  7   18 
           increases with detector thickness depends on the       T0129  7   19 
           time-of-flight and thus on the half-life of the        T0129  7   20 
           recoiling fission isomers. This difference in          T0129  7   21 
           detection efficiency of the two foils allows the       T0129  7   22 
           determination of the cross section ratio.              T0129  7   23
