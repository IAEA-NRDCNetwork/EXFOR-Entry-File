          RStacked detector technique. Ratios Were measured using T012900700013 
            a detector stack of two different thickness due to    T012900700014 
            the fact that detection efficiency varies with the    T012900700015 
            minimum dip angle of the impinging fission fragments. T012900700016 
            This minimum dip angle which increases with detector  T012900700017 
            thickness depends on the time-of-fligth and thus on   T012900700018 
            the half-life of the recoiling fission isomers. This  T012900700019 
            difference in detection efficiency of the two foils   T012900700020 
            allows the determination of the cross section ratio.  T012900700021
