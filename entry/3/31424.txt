SAMPLE     A known weight of thorium nitrate was first dissolved  3142400100008 
           in 10 cm**3 distilled water and 0.25 cm**3 of this     3142400100009 
           solution was deposited on some Lexan plastics and      3142400100010 
           dried with an infrared lamp.                           3142400100011 
MONITOR    (92-U-238(N,F),,SIG) Uranyl nitrate samples were       3142400100012 
           prepared in the same way and under the same conditions 3142400100013 
           as the thorium nitrate samples.                        3142400100014

DETECTOR   (TRD) Pieces of Lexan plastic, 200 micrometer thick    3142400100019 
           and with an area of 1 cm**2. After irradiation the     3142400100020 
           plastic pieces were etched in 6.25 N NaOH solution.    3142400100021

ANALYSIS   From the average ratio of track densities on both      3142400100023 
           U-238 and Th-232 coated plastics, which were irradia-  3142400100024 
           ted for different lengths of time, the ratio of        3142400100025 
           neutron-induced fission cross sections of Th-232 to    3142400100026 
           U-238 was determined.                                  3142400100027
