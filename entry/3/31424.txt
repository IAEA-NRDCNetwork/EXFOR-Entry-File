SAMPLE     A known weight of thorium nitrate was first dissolved  31424  1    9 
           in 10 cm**3 distilled water and 0.25 cm**3 of this     31424  1   10 
           solution was deposited on some Lexan plastics and      31424  1   11 
           dried with an infrared lamp.                           31424  1   12

DETECTOR   (TRD) Pieces of Lexan plastic, 200 micrometer thick    31424  1   20 
           and with an area of 1 cm**2. After irradiation the     31424  1   21

           neutron-induced fission cross sections of Th-232 to    31424  1   27 
           U-238 was determined.                                  31424  1   28
