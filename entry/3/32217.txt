           DGDK-32B was placed at the horizontal channel and used 3221700100040 
           to determine the incident neutron flux.                3221700100041

           (HE3SP)Exposing the tantalic targets, simultaneously   3221700100047 
           the monitoring of the neutron flux has been done by the3221700100048 
           neutron spectrometer with 3He-counter. The measurements3221700100049 
           of the neutron beam have been done every 1000 s after  3221700100050 
           each 2600 s of the total exposition.                   3221700100051 
SAMPLE     The tantalic targets were made of natural tantalum foil3221700100052 
           and the targets had the 28.0 mm diameter. A pile of    3221700100053 
           four 0.2 mm thickness targets and a pile of eight      3221700100054 
           0.1 mm thickness targets were used for measurements    3221700100055 
           with 2 keV and 59 keV filter, respectively. Percentage 3221700100056

CORRECTION Correction on the resonance self-shielding of neutrons 3221700100062 
           in the tantalic samples was done. The real values of   3221700100063 
           cross-sections were received by extrapolation the      3221700100064 
           observed cross sections to zero thickness of the       3221700100065 
           samples.                                               3221700100066 
           To estimate a share of cross-section from the impure   3221700100067 
           lines, a numerical simulation was performed.           3221700100068 
           Corrections for backward scattering of neutrons by the 3221700100069 
           output collimator were computed with program package   3221700100070 
           MCNP-4C for real irradiation conditions.               3221700100071
