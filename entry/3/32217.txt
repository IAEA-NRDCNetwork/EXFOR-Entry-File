           the monitoring of the neutron flux has been done by the3221700100030 
           neutron spectrometer with 3He-counter. The measurements3221700100031 
           of the neutron beam have been done every 1000 s after  3221700100032

SAMPLE     (73-TA-181,ENR=0.99988) The tantalic targets were made 3221700100034 
           of natural tantalum foil and the targets had the       3221700100035

           (5-B-10,ENR=0.85) The boron target used to define the  3221700100037 
           neutron flux value, was made of the boric powder,      3221700100038 
           enriched by 10B. This target is placed inside the      3221700100039 
           container  with 28 mm diameter. The thickness of the   3221700100040

CORRECTION Correction on the resonance self-shielding of neutrons 3221700100053 
           in the tantalic samples was done. The real values of   3221700100054 
           cross-sections were received by extrapolation the      3221700100055 
           observed cross sections to zero thickness of the       3221700100056 
           samples.                                               3221700100057 
           To estimate a share of cross-section from the impure   3221700100058 
           lines, a numerical simulation was performed.           3221700100059 
           Corrections for backward scattering of neutrons by the 3221700100060 
           output collimator were computed with program package   3221700100061 
           MCNP-4C for real irradiation conditions.               3221700100062 
MONITOR    (5-B-10(N,A)3-LI-7,PAR,SIG,G) The neutron flux was     3221700100063 
           defined by area of the full absorption peak of gamma   3221700100064 
           rays with 478 keV energy (the excited state of 7Li).   3221700100065 
           Cross sections of the 10B(n,alpha+gamma)7Li* reaction  3221700100066 
           were calculated as mean values of the averaged on a    3221700100067
