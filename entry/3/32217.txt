           neutron spectrometer with 3He-counter. The measurements3221700100031 
           of the neutron beam have been done every 1000 s after  3221700100032

SAMPLE     The tantalic targets were made of natural tantalum foil3221700100034 
           and the targets had the 28.0 mm diameter. A pile of    3221700100035 
           four 0.2 mm thickness targets and a pile of eight      3221700100036 
           0.1 mm thickness targets were used for measurements    3221700100037 
           with 2 keV and 59 keV filter, respectively. Percentage 3221700100038

CORRECTION Correction on the resonance self-shielding of neutrons 3221700100051 
           in the tantalic samples was done. The real values of   3221700100052

           To estimate a share of cross-section from the impure   3221700100056 
           lines, a numerical simulation was performed.           3221700100057 
           Corrections for backward scattering of neutrons by the 3221700100058
