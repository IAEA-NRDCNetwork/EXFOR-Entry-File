FACILITY   (REAC,3CPRAEP) Heavy water reactor                     3282000100009 
INC-SOURCE (REAC) The reactor power was 100 kW and the neutron    3282000100010 
           flux was about 5E3 n/s/cm2.                            3282000100011 
SAMPLE     20% enriched uranium is plated on both sides of the    3282000100012 
           aluminum foil using a neutral alcohol solution         3282000100013 
           electroplating method, with a thickness of 0.5         3282000100014 
           mg/cm2. There were 14 sheets in total.                 3282000100015 
METHOD     Neutrons were moderated by heavy water and measured    3282000100016 
           by the BF3 detector.The container for heavy water was  3282000100017 
           a large cylinder made of Al, with an outer diameter    3282000100018 
           of 800 mm, a length of 700 mm, and a wall thickness    3282000100019 
           of 5 mm. The center of the cylinder was a cylindrical  3282000100020 
           cavity for placing a fission ionization chamber, with  3282000100021 
           an inner diameter of 65 mm. Around the cavity, 40 Al   3282000100022 
           tubes with a diameter of 37 mm were symmetrically      3282000100023 
           arranged (divided into three circles, each with 8, 12, 3282000100024 
           and 20 tubes), and BF3 were placed inside. A graphite  3282000100025 
           reflector with a thickness of 500 mm was stacked       3282000100026 
           around the system. At the end of the horizontal        3282000100027 
           transport channel, a graphite pillar(phi 145 * 600     3282000100028 
           mm) was place to the active zone. The cadmium ratio    3282000100029 
           of the neutron beam increased from 10 to 56. The       3282000100030 
           collimator placed in the horizontal channel is made    3282000100031 
           of boron containing paraffin, with a central aperture  3282000100032 
           of 6.5 mm, an outer diameter of 200 mm, and a length   3282000100033 
           of 1200 mm. The lead protective layer(600*600*600      3282000100034 
           mm3) was at the orifice, with a central square hole    3282000100035 
           size of 20*20 mm2. Paraffin layer containing B (100mm  3282000100036 
           thick) and Cd sheet are used to shield the entire      3282000100037 
           system. The system efficiency was 14.72 %. The         3282000100038 
           measurement time was about 50 hours.                   3282000100039 
DETECTOR   (BF3) 2 groups of BF3 were used. One group was 12 CHM- 3282000100040 
           8 (B-10 concentration of 80%, 35 mm in diameter, 1000  3282000100041 
           mm long, inflation pressure of 400 millimeters of      3282000100042 
           mercury, working voltage 2400 V, flat width 300 V).    3282000100043 
           The other was 19 CHM-7 (B-10 concentration of 90%, 35  3282000100044 
           mm in diameter, 550 mm long, inflation pressure of     3282000100045 
           400 millimeters of mercury, working voltage 2600 V,    3282000100046 
           flat width 100 V). Total content of boron was 4.33     3282000100047 
           grams.                                                 3282000100048 
           (FISCH) The fission ionization chamber was entirely    3282000100049 
           made of Al, with a diameter of 60mm and a length of    3282000100050 
           150mm. The thickness of the front and back walls was   3282000100051 
           less than 1mm. The ionization chamber was filled with  3282000100052 
           Ar gas with a height of 600 mm of mercury, and the     3282000100053 
           working voltage was negative 200 V.                    3282000100054

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The first source of uncertainty was from    3282000100057 
           statistics, especially the statistical uncertainties   3282000100058 
           of 5, 4 and 3 neutrons emission probability. The       3282000100059 
           second source of uncertainty was from detector         3282000100060 
           efficiency. The uncertainties from instrument          3282000100061 
           instability and electronic gate width instability      3282000100062 
           were ignored for far less than statistical uncertainty.3282000100063
