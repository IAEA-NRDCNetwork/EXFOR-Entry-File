COMMENT    Author's comment: "As no 5.5 MeV level was observed in 3123500200005 
           this work, its cross section for inelastic scattering  3123500200006 
           of 14. MeV neutrons must be much less than 1.9 mb/sr   3123500200007 
           estimated by Regis et al., but this does not provide   3123500200008 
           evidence against its existance, since the known higher 3123500200009 
           energy levels were not seen."                          3123500200010
