INC-SOURCE (D-T) Tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target was at distances  32779  1   12 
           of about 40 mm. Neutrons were produced with an         32779  1   13 
           effective deuteron beam energy of 136 keV and beam     32779  1   14

SAMPLE     (63-EU-151,NAT=0.4781) Approximately 10 g of high      32779  1   16 
           purity Eu2O3 powder was pressed at 980 MPa, and a      32779  1   17 
           pellet, about 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter was  32779  1   18 
           obtained. Three such pellets were prepared. Monitor    32779  1   19 
           foils (Nb, 99.99% pure, 0.5 mm thick) of the same      32779  1   20 
           diameter as the pellets were then attached in front    32779  1   21 
           and at the back of each sample.                        32779  1   22 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation lasted about 120 min with a yield  32779  1   23 
           of about 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s). The groups of samples    32779  1   24 
           were placed at 0, 90 or 135 deg angle relative to the  32779  1   25 
           beam direction. After the irradiation process, three   32779  1   26 
           samples were cooled for 1 h-6.5 years.                 32779  1   27

           relative efficiency of about 68% and an energy         32779  1   31 
           resolution of 1.69 keV at 1332 keV for 60Co. The       32779  1   32 
           efficiency of the detector was pre-calibrated using    32779  1   33 
           various standard gamma sources, which were 57Co, 60Co, 32779  1   34
