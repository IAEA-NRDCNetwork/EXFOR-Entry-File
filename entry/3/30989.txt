SAMPLE     Natural and depleted uranium foils of 9 mm diameter    3098900100008 
           and 0.1 to 0.32 mm thick. Purity was determined to be  3098900100009 
           92.5% by neutron activation, using standard uranium    3098900100010 
           foil, and chemical analysis.                           3098900100011 
INC-SOURCE (CF252) Neutron flux was determined from the informa-  3098900100012 
           tion provided by the manufacturer. The contribution of 3098900100013 
           spontaneous fission neutrons of Cm-248 to the neutron  3098900100014 
           flux density was estimated to be 0.13%.                3098900100015

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Cross section was calculated from the pure     3098900100019 
           activity of Te-132 which was determined from the net   3098900100020 
           area under the 228.2 keV photopeak.                    3098900100021 
CORRECTION The net area of the 228.2 keV photopeak of Te-132 was  3098900100022 
           corrected for branching ratio, gamma-ray self          3098900100023 
           absorption, fission yield, detector efficiency,        3098900100024 
           irradiation time, decay time, counting time and        3098900100025 
           interferences from neighbouring photopeaks of Np-239   3098900100026 
           and Pa-234. The relative contributions from these      3098900100027 
           photopeaks to the 228.20 keV peak of Te-132 were       3098900100028 
           determined by measuring the net areas under 278.0 keV  3098900100029 
           and 1001.0 keV of Np-239 and Pa-234 respectively.      3098900100030
