SAMPLE     Natural and depleted uranium foils of 9 mm diameter    30989  1    8 
           and 0.1 to 0.32 mm thick. Purity was determined to be  30989  1    9 
           92.5% by neutron activation, using standard uranium    30989  1   10 
           foil, and chemical analysis.                           30989  1   11 
INC-SOURCE (CF252) Neutron flux was determined from the informa-  30989  1   12 
           tion provided by the manufacturer. The contribution of 30989  1   13 
           spontaneous fission neutrons of Cm-248 to the neutron  30989  1   14 
           flux density was estimated to be 0.13%.                30989  1   15

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Cross section was calculated from the pure     30989  1   19 
           activity of Te-132 which was determined from the net   30989  1   20 
           area under the 228.2 keV photopeak.                    30989  1   21 
CORRECTION The net area of the 228.2 keV photopeak of Te-132 was  30989  1   22 
           corrected for branching ratio, gamma-ray self          30989  1   23 
           absorption, fission yield, detector efficiency,        30989  1   24 
           irradiation time, decay time, counting time and        30989  1   25 
           interferences from neighbouring photopeaks of Np-239   30989  1   26 
           and Pa-234. The relative contributions from these      30989  1   27 
           photopeaks to the 228.20 keV peak of Te-132 were       30989  1   28 
           determined by measuring the net areas under 278.0 keV  30989  1   29 
           and 1001.0 keV of Np-239 and Pa-234 respectively.      30989  1   30
