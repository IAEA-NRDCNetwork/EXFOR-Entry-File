SAMPLE     The Pu-239 and U-235 conversion targets were placed    3282600100009 
           on the collimated neutron beam. The three types of     3282600100010 
           indicator foils were metal aluminum, quartz crystal    3282600100011 
           and mixture of (NH4)2HPO4 and pure paraffin. The       3282600100012 
           intensity of neutron on the indicator foil was about   3282600100013 
           1E8 n/cm2/s.                                           3282600100014 
DETECTOR   (LONGC) The beta counting device included bell shaped  3282600100015 
           Geiger beta counter, high voltage stabilized power     3282600100016 
           supply and scaler. The stability was tested using a    3282600100017 
           U3O8 standard beta source.                             3282600100018

METHOD     (ACTIV) Four dosimetry reactions were selected to      3282600100020 
           determine the parameter beta(239Pu), which are         3282600100021 
           31P(n,p)31Si, 27Al(n,p)27Mg, 28Si(n,p)28Al and         3282600100022 
           27Al(n,a)24Na, the half-life of the reaction products  3282600100023 
           are 2.62 hours, 9.5 minutes, 2.3 minutes and 15        3282600100024 
           hours. The indicator foils were removed after two      3282600100025 
           hours irradiation, then the beta radioactivity of the  3282600100026 
           reaction products were measured, the Al indicator      3282600100027 
           foils were measured after cooling for 25 minutes.      3282600100028
