            backing by electro deposition using isopropyl alcohol 3300200100014 
METHOD     (REC) The fission fragments were collected by the      3300200100015 
             thin target-recoil-catcher technique.                3300200100016

MONITOR    235U targets (0.1 ug) were irradiated together with    3300200100029 
            the 229Th targets (30 ug).                            3300200100030 
           Activities of the 235U fission products were measured  3300200100031 
            in the same way as those of 229Th.                    3300200100032 
           The 235U  fission product mass chain yields were taken 3300200100033 
            from the compilation of Meek and Rider.               3300200100034 
           The 91Sr yield is used as monitor for yield of any     3300200100035 
            other fission products of 229Th.                      3300200100036 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay of each product was followed for     3300200100037 
             suitable length of time to determine the activity at 3300200100038 
             the end of irradiation                               3300200100039 
            Assuming that charge distribution pattern is similar  3300200100040 
             in 229Th and 235U fission, the chain yields of 235U  3300200100041 
             were used to calculate the respective chain yields   3300200100042 
             in 229Th.                                            3300200100043 
            91Sr was taken as an internal standard for both 229Th 3300200100044 
             and 235U fission, so as to eliminate any error due   3300200100045 
             to change in flux from one irradiation to another.   3300200100046 
            The final mass yield values were obtained by          3300200100047 
             normalising the area under the mass distribution     3300200100048 
             curve to 200%.                                       3300200100049 
CORRECTION Chemical yield corrections were incorporated wherever  3300200100050 
            chemistry was carried out.                            3300200100051 
           The decay for a suitable number of gamma rays of       3300200100052 
            the nuclides were followed for suitable length of     3300200100053 
            time to determine the activity at the end of          3300200100054 
            irradiation.                                          3300200100055 
           The correction for the decay during the irradiation    3300200100056 
            were getting cancelled as the samples were irradiated 3300200100057 
            simultaneously both for 229Th and 235U.               3300200100058 
           The errors due detector efficiency, self absorption    3300200100059 
            and scattering were getting cancelled as the samples  3300200100060 
            were counted in similar geometry.                     3300200100061 
           It was assumed that the genetic relations are same     3300200100062 
            both in case of 229Th and 235U fission products and   3300200100063 
            under the conditions of the experiment.               3300200100064 
           The correction due to fast fission of 229Th and 235U   3300200100065 
            were negligible.                                      3300200100066 
           No corrections were applied for neutron capture.       3300200100067
