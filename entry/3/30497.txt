INC-SOURCE Thermal neutrons were produced by placing a 5 cm       3049700100012 
           paraffine block in the neutron path.                   3049700100013 
           (P-LI7) Neutron-energy spread about 40 keV.            3049700100014 
           (P-T) Neutron-energy spread about 160 keV.             3049700100015 
           The average fission rate ~2.5 X 10**3 sec-1 and        3049700100016 
           neutron flux was estimated about 5 X 10**7 n/cm2/sec.  3049700100017 
SAMPLE     A 235U target (5 mg/cm2 thick, ~4 cm2 area).           3049700100018 
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Filled with high purity argon, pressure of      3049700100019 
           1.1 atm.                                               3049700100020 
           (SIBAR) Surface-barrier, depletion depth 400 um,       3049700100021 
           mounted inside the ionization chamber to detect the    3049700100022 
           light charged particles ('LCP').                       3049700100023 
METHOD     The natural alphas and the fission fragments were      3049700100024 
           stopped in an aluminum foil before reaching the        3049700100025 
           LCP-detector.                                          3049700100026 
           (COINC) After each coinc- run, ungated LCP-spectra     3049700100027 
           were recorded in order to determine chance             3049700100028 
           coincidences. Before and after each fast-neutron run,  3049700100029 
           thermal runs were performed to check the detector      3049700100030 
           performance and for normalization of the LCP-spectra.  3049700100031 
ANALYSIS   A Gaussian was fitted by least squares method to the   3049700100032 
           measured spectra beyond 12 MeV. The LCP-yields above   3049700100033 
           12 MeV were attributed to alpha-particles alone.       3049700100034 
           The difference between measured spectra from 6.5 to    3049700100035 
           12 MeV and Gaussian was assumed to be due to tritons.  3049700100036 
           The quoted alpha and triton yields relative to thermal 3049700100037 
           were obtained through this assumption.                 3049700100038
