SAMPLE     About 5 gram of Ru powder of natural isotope           3270200100016 
           composition (99.99% purity) was pressed at 10 t/cm2,   3270200100017 
           and a pellet, 0.2 cm thick and 2.0 cm in diameter.     3270200100018 
           Monitor foils of Al (99.999% pure, 0.04 mm thick) of   3270200100019 
           the same diameter as the pellets were then attached    3270200100020 
           in front and at the back of each sample.               3270200100021 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The crystal geometry is 70.1 x 72.3 mm in       3270200100022
