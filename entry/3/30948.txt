SAMPLE     natural uranium in the form of pure ammonium diuranate 3094800100008 
METHOD     (RCHEM) For spontaneous fission measurements, large    3094800100009 
           amounts of uranium are required. Initial separation:   3094800100010 
           by sulphide precipitation from a UO2Cl2 solution in 3 M3094800100011 
           HCl. Further purification was carried out using        3094800100012 
           standard radiochemical procedures.                     3094800100013 
           (ABSFY) Absolute fission yields were obtained from the 3094800100014 
           fission product activities in equilibrium with the     3094800100015 
           spontaneous fission rate. The latter was determined    3094800100016 
           from the sample weight and the spontaneous fission half3094800100017 
           life of U-238.                                         3094800100018 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Flat circular gas-flow Geiger Mueller counter, 3094800100019 
            1.12% ethylene in argon; background: 0.7+-0.1 cpm.    3094800100020 
CORRECTION Since natural uranium was used, the contribution from  3094800100021 
           U-235 fission induced by U-238 spontaneous fission     3094800100022 
           neutrons was calculated to be about 5%, and it was     3094800100023 
           concluded that no correction was necessary.            3094800100024

ANALYSIS   Each nuclide was determined 3 times.                   3094800200004 
           (DECAY) The decay curves were analysed and the half    3094800200005 
            lives obtained were 66,36 and 78 hrs for Mo-99,Rh-105 3094800200006 
            and Te-132 respectively, in good agreement with the   3094800200007 
            recommended values in the Nuclear Data Sheets.        3094800200008 
            The latter were used for least squares analysis of the3094800200009 
            counting data to obtain the equilibrium count rate.   3094800200010
