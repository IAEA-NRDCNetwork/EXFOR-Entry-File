INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutron with a yiels of about 2E11 n/s was       32787  1   15 
           produced.                                              32787  1   16 
SAMPLE     The natural abundance uranium sesquioxide (U2O3, 98%   32787  1   17 
           purity) powder for uranium target was pressed into     32787  1   18 
           circular disk with a diameter of 12.0 mm and a         32787  1   19 
           thickness of about 1.0 mm. Each sample disk was        32787  1   20 
           covered by a polyethylene film, and then sandwiched    32787  1   21 
           between two thin pure aluminum foils (99.99% purity).  32787  1   22 
           Three U2O3 samples (with mass around 1 g), which were  32787  1   23 
           placed at 0 deg, 45 deg and 90 deg angles related to   32787  1   24 
           the deuteron beam direction and centered about the     32787  1   25 
           T-Ti target at a distance of 4.0 cm.                   32787  1   26

           spectrometer with 68% relative efficiency and 1.7 keV  32787  1   28 
           energy resolution at 1332.5 keV.                       32787  1   29 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Two sets of measurement schemes were arranged  32787  1   30 
           to distinguish the short half-life and long half-life  32787  1   31 
           fragments. Firstly, the samples after irradiating and  32787  1   32 
           cooling (4.5 min) were measured by the HPGe detector   32787  1   33 
           about 90.0 min for the gamma-spectrum accumulation     32787  1   34 
           from short half-life nuclides. Meanwhile, the          32787  1   35 
           gamma-spectrum was recorded every minute during this   32787  1   36 
           measurement (about 90.0 min) , so as to investigate    32787  1   37 
           the nuclide with much shorter half-life. Secondly,     32787  1   38 
           after a long cooling time (24 h) the samples were      32787  1   39 
           measured for every 12 h, and more than twenty gamma    32787  1   40 
           spectra were recorded.                                 32787  1   41

CORRECTION Correction factor F=Fg*Fs*Fc includes three parts:     32787  1   48 
           The geometry correction factor (Fg) which originates   32787  1   49 
           from volume effect of samples. The self-absorption     32787  1   50 
           correction factor (Fs) caused by the gamma-ray         32787  1   51 
           absorption as penetrating the sample itself, which     32787  1   52 
           becomes more negligible with the increase of           32787  1   53 
           gamma-ray energy. The correction (Fc) is due to the    32787  1   54 
           coincidence sum effect of cascade gamma-rays.          32787  1   55 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The uncertainties mainly come from the         32787  1   56 
           counting statistics of the characteristic peak,        32787  1   57 
           detection effciency and the self-absorption. Other     32787  1   58 
           uncertainties, caused by the weight of samples,        32787  1   59 
           sample geometry, coincidence sum effect of cascade     32787  1   60 
           gamma-rays, neutron energy and fluence, the time       32787  1   61 
           schedule and the cross-section of monitor reaction,    32787  1   62

            The measurement shows that the 134I yield is          32787  2    9 
            negligible in comparison with the 134Te yield.        32787  2   10
