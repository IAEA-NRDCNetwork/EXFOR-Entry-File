INC-SOURCE (P-T) The Ti-3H thin film target of this experiment    3159200100013 
           was provided by a company (SODERN) in France. The      3159200100014 
           substrate of this target was Cu with a thickness of    3159200100015 
           1.2 mm. The first layer was Ti with an areal density   3159200100016 
           between 200 mu-g/cm2 (2.5.10**18 atoms/cm2) and 300    3159200100017 
           mu-g/cm2 (3.8.10**18 atoms/cm2). Ti was impregnated    3159200100018 
           with tritium of 4.6.10**18 atoms/cm2.                  3159200100019 
           The control of the beam energy and the stability for   3159200100020 
           terminal voltage was performed by the resonance of     3159200100021 
           991+-1 keV in 27Al(p,gamma) and that of 3047+-1 keV    3159200100022 
           in 16O(alpha,alpha).                                   3159200100023 
SAMPLE     The shape of Fe sample with a purity of 98% was a      3159200100024 
           disk with a diameter of 5 cm and a thickness of 0.3 cm.3159200100025 
METHOD     (PHD,PSD,GSPEC)                                        3159200100026 
           (FLUX) The flux in the beam direction was              3159200100027 
           determined to be 3.76x10**7 n/s/sr. The neutron flux   3159200100028 
           was  measured by fast neutron activation using Au      3159200100029 
           sample, with purity of 99.99%, a metal disk with a     3159200100030 
           diameter of 5 cm and a thickness of 0.3 cm.            3159200100031 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The pulse-height spectrum and the pulse-shape   3159200100032 
           spectrum of the produced neutron were measured by      3159200100033 
           2"x2" BC-501 liquid scintillation detector.            3159200100034 
           Other BC-501 liquid scintillation detector is used as  3159200100035

           (HPGE) A 2"x2" HP Ge detector was used as a detector   3159200100037 
           of gamma-rays.                                         3159200100038
