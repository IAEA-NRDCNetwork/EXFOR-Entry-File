SAMPLE     The natural Manganese powder of 99.9% purity was made  3270100100010 
            into circular thin samples with a diameter of 20 mm   3270100100011 
            and the thickness of 1.5-2.6 mm, which were           3270100100012 
            sandwiched between two disks of thin Al of the same   3270100100013 
            diameter. The purity of the Al metal was better than  3270100100014 
            99.99%.                                               3270100100015 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity   3270100100016 
            germanium (HPGe) detector was used with 70.1x72.3 mm  3270100100017 
            in diameter and length for the crystal, respectively. 3270100100018 
           The relative efficiency was about 68%, and the energy  3270100100019 
            resolution was about 1.69 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.     3270100100020 
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiation of the samples was carried   3270100100021 
            out and lasted 15 min with a neutron yield of about   3270100100022 
            3E10 to 5E10 n/s.                                     3270100100023

           The cross section values of the monitor reaction were  3270100100027 
            obtained by interpolating the evaluated work of the   3270100100028 
            literature.                                           3270100100029
