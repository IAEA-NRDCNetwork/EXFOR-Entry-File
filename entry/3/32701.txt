SAMPLE     The natural Manganese powder of 99.9% purity was made  3270100100011 
           into circular thin samples with a diameter of 20 mm    3270100100012 
           and the thickness of 1.5-2.6 mm, which were            3270100100013 
           sandwiched between two disks of thin Al of the same    3270100100014 
           diameter. The purity of the Al metal was better than   3270100100015 
           99.99%.                                                3270100100016 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity   3270100100017 
           germanium (HPGe) detector was used with 70.1x72.3 mm   3270100100018 
           in diameter and length for the crystal, respectively.  3270100100019 
           The relative efficiency was about 68%, and the energy  3270100100020 
           resolution was about 1.69 keV (FWHM) at 1.33 MeV.      3270100100021 
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) Irradiation of the samples was carried   3270100100022 
           out and lasted 15 min with a neutron yield of about    3270100100023 
           3E10 to 5E10 n/s.                                      3270100100024

CORRECTION Dead-time and pulse pileup corrections were less than  3270100100043

COMMENT    The reactions and associated decay data of products    3270100100048 
           were taken from Table 1 at page 1564 in J,IPC,81,(10), 3270100100049 
           1563,201204. In Table 1, the half-life of 52V was      3270100100050 
           3.743 month. We have consulted the NUCLEAR WALLET      3270100100051 
           CARDS (Jagdish K. Tuli, Oct. 2011), and found the      3270100100052 
           half-life of 52V was 3.743 minutes. It was a clerical  3270100100053 
           mistake confirmed by the author.                       3270100100054
