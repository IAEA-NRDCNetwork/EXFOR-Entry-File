TITLE      Ruthenium and rhodium isotopes in spontaneous fission  3094500100006 
           of uranium-238                                         3094500100007 
SAMPLE     8 kg of ammonium diuranate                             3094500100008 
METHOD     (RCHEM).The separation procedures took 4 hrs for Ru    3094500100009 
            and 15 hrs for Rh.                                    3094500100010 
            For the Ru-105 measurement the activity was allowed to3094500100011 
            grow into the mother uranium solution for 30 hrs      3094500100012 
            before chemical sepapartion. For Rh-105 the grow-in   3094500100013 
            time was 10 days. The grow-in times correspond to     3094500100014 
            about 7 times the rspective half-lives, and it was    3094500100015 
            was assumed that equilibrium activity was reached.    3094500100016

ANALYSIS   The fission yield was calculated from the fission      3094500100019
