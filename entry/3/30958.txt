METHOD     (ABSFY).The number of fissions were determined using   3095800100010 
            the uranium weight and the U-238 spontaneous fission  3095800100011

            year half life by E.Segre, Phys.Rev.86(1959)21 was    3095800100013 
            used, as the yields agreed better with other published3095800100014 
            values.                                               3095800100015

SAMPLE     6 l solution containing 3.067 kg of uranium was used.  3095800200004 
           Mo carrier was added and all molybdenum in the sample  3095800200005 
           removed chemically.                                    3095800200006 
METHOD     (RCHEM).The solution stood for 21 days to accumulate   3095800200007 
           fission product molybdenum. Then again Mo carrier was  3095800200008 
           added and Mo precipitated and purified.                3095800200009 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curve for the molybdenum activity was3095800200010 
           measured for 15 days and found to follow the 67 hr half3095800200011 
           life of Mo-99.                                         3095800200012 
CORRECTION A standardised Mo-99 source was used to determine the  3095800200013 
           counter geometry and required corrections for back-    3095800200014 
           scattering and the finite shape of the measured source.3095800200015 
COMMENT    The MO-99 yield given in the DATA table is based on the3095800200016 
           U-238 spontaneous fission half life of 8.04E+15 years. 3095800200017 
           The 1.01E+16 years half life would have given a fission3095800200018 
           yield for Mo-99 of 7.2+-0.4.                           3095800200019

SAMPLE     4 l solution containing 4.015 kg of uranium was used.  3095800300004 
           Chemical procedures were applied and the solution      3095800300005 
           distilled to remove all iodine already present in the  3095800300006 
           sample.                                                3095800300007 
METHOD     (RCHEM).The solution stood for 8 days to accumulate    3095800300008 
           fission product iodine. The procedure for purification 3095800300009 
           from iodine (see SAMPLE above) was repeated. The       3095800300010 
           extracted solution stood for 2 more days to allow the  3095800300011 
           short lived iodine isotopes to decay. Then the iodine  3095800300012 
           was further purified, precipitate as AgI and prepared  3095800300013 
           for beta counting.                                     3095800300014 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curve was decomposed into a 20.8 hr  3095800300015 
           component (I-133) and an 8 day component (I-131).      3095800300016 
CORRECTION The counter was calibrated using K2SO4 (as beta        3095800300017 
           energies of natural potassium are similar to those of  3095800300018 
           I-133). For self-absorption and backscattering         3095800300019 
           corrections, a source containing I-133 was produced.   3095800300020 
COMMENT    The authors state that their I-131 yield is lower than 3095800300021 
           that reported by other authors. The reason could be    3095800300022 
           that their experiment was designed to measure the I-1333095800300023 
           yield and they did not allow sufficient time to produce3095800300024 
           enough I-131. The discrepancy was probably due to      3095800300025 
           low counts and poor statistics.                        3095800300026 
           The iodine yields given in the DATA table are based on 3095800300027 
           the U-238 spontaneous fission half life of 8.04E+15    3095800300028
