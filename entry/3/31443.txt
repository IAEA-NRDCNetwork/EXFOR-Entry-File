INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a deuterium 3144300100012 
           gas cell ( 4.3 atm.) with a 7.4 MeV pulsed deuteron    3144300100013 
           beam.                                                  3144300100014 
SAMPLE     Natural uranium electro-deposited on both sides of     3144300100015 
           0.2 mm thick plates of stainless steel with deposition 3144300100016 
           thickness of about 0.5 mg/cm**2.                       3144300100017 
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) Fission fragments were detected by a       3144300100018 
           paralell-plate ionization chamber which operated in    3144300100019 
           multi-segment mode and was filled with pure methane at 3144300100020 
           a pressure of 4.3 atm. Fission neutrons were detected  3144300100021 
           by two liquid scintillators both placed at 100 degrees 3144300100022 
           with respect to the incident neutron beam and at 2.3 m 3144300100023 
           from the ionization chamber.                           3144300100024 
METHOD     (TOF,COINC,PSD)  The incident-neutron tof spectrum was 3144300100025 
           obtained from the fission-fragment event signals with  3144300100026 
           the pulsed-beam tof method. A liquid scintillator,     3144300100027 
           located at 0 deg. and 3.1 m down stream of the gas     3144300100028 
           cell served as monitor of the incident-neutron Tof     3144300100029 
           spectrum. Fission neutrons were selected by requiring  3144300100030 
           coincidence between neutron detector-  and fission-    3144300100031 
           fragment detector events which also provided the       3144300100032 
           fission-neutron tof spectra. Events induced by the     3144300100033 
           10.17 and 12.12 MeV incident neutrons were software    3144300100034 
           selected by gating the tof spectrum of secundary neu-  3144300100035 
           trons with the 10.17 and 12.12 MeV peaks of the in-    3144300100036 
           cident-neutron spectra. Pulse-shape discrimination was 3144300100037 
           applied to eliminate gamma-ray background.             3144300100038 
ANALYSIS   The measured spectrum was fitted by a Maxwellian       3144300100039 
           distribution.                                          3144300100040
