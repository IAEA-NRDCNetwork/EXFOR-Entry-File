INC-SOURCE (D-D) The deuteron beam current of 300 mA and beam     32731  1   10 
           energy of 2.0 MeV. The solid Tritium-Ti target had a   32731  1   11 
           thickness of approximately 1.20 mg/cm2.                32731  1   12 
SAMPLE     (49-IN-115,NAT=0.957) The 115In samples were pure      32731  1   13 
           indium with a purity of higher than 99.99%. Disks of   32731  1   14 
           pure indium, 0.5 mm in thickness and 10 mm in          32731  1   15 
           diameter, were sandwiched between two Au foils of 0.3  32731  1   16 
           mm in thickness. These foils were wrapped with 0.3 mm  32731  1   17 
           in thickness cadmium box and put into 90 deg angle     32731  1   18 
           relative to the deuteron beam direction. Samples at    32731  1   19 
           the high energy neutron emitting direction between 0   32731  1   20 
           deg and 60 deg, were not sandwiched between the Au     32731  1   21 
           foils.                                                 32731  1   22 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Well-calibrated coaxial high-purity germanium   32731  1   23 
           detector (GEM30P4-76, ORTEC, USA), with an entrance    32731  1   24 
           window thickness of 1.5 mm, a sensitive volume of 75   32731  1   25 
           cm3 and a sensitive diameter of 60 mm. The detector    32731  1   26 
           has 20% relative efficiency and an energy resolution   32731  1   27 
           of 1.85 keV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.                          32731  1   28 
METHOD     (ACTIV) 8-h of irradiation.                            32731  1   29 
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the multiple scattering (S)  32731  1   30 
           and the flux attenuation (F). The total correction     32731  1   31 
           factor was calculated by F = S x D. For 2.95 MeV,      32731  1   32 
           3.94 MeV and 5.24 MeV, S were 1.013, 0.977 and 1.016,  32731  1   33 
           D were 0.960, 0.970 and 0.966, F were 0.973, 0.948     32731  1   34 
           and 0.981.                                             32731  1   35

            activity and the (d,n) angular differential cross     32731  2   10
