INC-SOURCE (RA-BE) A 100 mc Ra-alpha-Be neutron source was placed 3127600100010 
            at the centre of an aluminium sphere which was filled 3127600100011 
            with paraffin wax. The radius of the sphere was 10-30 3127600100012 
            cm which corresponds to the optimum thermal neutron   3127600100013 
            output from a paraffin wax moderator                  3127600100014 
INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum.                                      3127600100015 
SAMPLE     Precise B-10 abundance in sample is unknown.           3127600100016 
           Three different concentrations of the boric acid       3127600100017 
            solution (1.254,1.481 and 1.675 g/100 c.c of solution)3127600100018 
METHOD     (TRN) Spherical transmission method                    3127600100019 
DETECTOR   The outcoming neutrons were detected by an indium foil 3127600100020 
            of thickness 110 g/cm2. The indium foil was activated 3127600100021 
            for nearly five half-lives of 116In, and the induced  3127600100022 
            activity was followed for 1.5 hrs. The counting rate  3127600100023 
            was extrapolated to zero time. Initial activity due   3127600100024 
            to thermal neutrons only was obtained by the cadmium  3127600100025 
            difference technique.                                 3127600100026
