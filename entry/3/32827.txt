INC-SOURCE (REAC) Using a crystal neutron spectrometer, the       3282700100008 
           neutron beam E=0.0253 eV was selected from heavy-water 3282700100009 
           reactor. NaCl (200) crystal was used as the            3282700100010 
           monochromator for the spectrometer.Between the         3282700100011 
           NaCl(200) monochromator and the measured sample a      3282700100012 
           mechanical monochromator was inserted in order to cut  3282700100013 
           off the neutrons with high energy. The high energy     3282700100014 
           neutron was less than 1%.                              3282700100015 
SAMPLE     Nuclear emulsion of U was made of U3O8 powder.         3282700100016 
           Impurity content was less than 0.4%. The abundance of  3282700100017 
           235U was 20.2%(1+-0.1%). The sample was made into      3282700100018 
           uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2) and added to the liquid     3282700100019 
           emulsion in its aqueous solution. Nuclear emulsion of  3282700100020 
           B was made of boric acid.                              3282700100021 
DETECTOR   (TRD) Nuclear emulsion                                 3282700100022 
METHOD     4 pieces of nuclear emulsions were used. The 1st and   3282700100023 
           4th were B, the 2nd and 3rd were U. The 1st and 2nd    3282700100024 
           were separated by Al foil in thickness of 100 um. The  3282700100025 
           3rd and 4th were the same. The irradiation time was 8  3282700100026 
           hours.                                                 3282700100027
