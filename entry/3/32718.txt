SAMPLE     (92-U-235,ENR=0.902)Isotopic composition of the sample 3271800100011 
           are 234U(1.1%), 235U(90.2%), 236U(0.3%) and            3271800100012 
           238U(8.4%). The thick uranium target with 16 mm in     3271800100013 
           diameter and 0.6-0.8 g/cm2 in mass thickness, was      3271800100014 
           wrapped by pure aluminium foil with 5 mg/cm2 in mass   3271800100015 
           thickness. The thin uranium target with 16 mm in       3271800100016 
           diameter and 0.3-0.4 mg/cm2 in mass thickness, was     3271800100017 
           electrodeposited on the platinum foil with 0.10-0.15   3271800100018 
           mm thickness.                                          3271800100019 
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) The 0.57 MeV neutrons were obtained by         3271800100020 
           7Li(p,n)7Be. LiF target thickness is 1 mg/cm2. The     3271800100021 
           incident energies of proton is 2.36 MeV.               3271800100022 
           (P-T) The 1.0 and 1.5 MeV neutrons were obtained by    3271800100023 
           T(p,n)3He. T-Ti target thickness is 5 mg/cm2. The      3271800100024 
           incident energies of proton are 2.05 and 2.50 MeV.     3271800100025 
METHOD     (ABSFY,GSPEC) Absolute measurements of the cumulative  3271800100026 
           yields of fission product 99Mo were determined for     3271800100027 
           the fission of 235U induced by 0.57, 1.0 and 1.5 MeV   3271800100028 
           neutrons. Fission product activities were measured by  3271800100029 
           HPGe gamma ray spectrometry. Absolute fission rate     3271800100030 
           was monitored with a double-fission chamber.           3271800100031 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The volume of HPGe detector is 110 cm3. The     3271800100032 
           energy resolution is 1.8 keV for 60Co at 1332.5 keV    3271800100033 
           gamma ray.                                             3271800100034 
           (FISCH) Double-fission chamber were used to measure    3271800100035 
           the absolute fission rate, and monitor the changing    3271800100036 
           of fission rate with time.                             3271800100037 
ANALYSIS   Decay gamma spectrum area were determined with SPAN    3271800100038 
           code, and fission cumulative yields were calculated by 3271800100039 
           FYAUTOLS code.                                         3271800100040 
CORRECTION The main correction is the gamma-ray self-absorption   3271800100041 
           in the target. The effects of all kinds of secondary   3271800100042 
           neutrons on fission yield data were discussed.         3271800100043

           (ERR-S) The uncertainty of gamma counting statistics.  3271800100045 
           (ERR-1) The uncertainty of fission rate is 2.0%.       3271800100046 
           (ERR-2) The uncertainty of efficiency calibration is   3271800100047 
           2.0%.                                                  3271800100048

STATUS     (TABLE) The fission yield and total uncertainty data   3271800100050 
           were taken from Table 2, and the detailed              3271800100051
