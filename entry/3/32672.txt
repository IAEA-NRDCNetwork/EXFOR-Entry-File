SAMPLE     (30-ZN-67,ENR=0.954) Two 67Zn samples were back-to-    3267200100012 
            back as a set.                                        3267200100013 
           The mass and the thickness of the forward sample were  3267200100014 
            9.864 mg and 680 ug/cm2.                              3267200100015 
           The mass and the thickness of the backward sample were 3267200100016 
            6.818 mg and 470 ug/cm2.                              3267200100017 
           Each sample was vacuum-evaporated on a tantalum        3267200100018 
            backing of 4.8 cm in diameter and 50 um in thickness. 3267200100019 
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin gridded ionization chamber composed of   3267200100020 
            two symmetric sections with a common cathod was used  3267200100021 
            as charged-particle detector.                         3267200100022 
           The shape of the chamber is cylindrical, with diameter 3267200100023 
            28.2 cm and height 27.2 cm, and the thickness of the  3267200100024 
            stainless-steel wall is 2.0 mm.                       3267200100025 
           The chamber has one cathode, two grids, two anodes and 3267200100026 
            two shields.                                          3267200100027 
           The shape of the electrodes is rectangular.            3267200100028 
           The cathode and the anode are aluminum boards coated   3267200100029 
            with tungsten layer, and the grid was composed of     3267200100030 
            parallel tungsten wires coated  with gold 0.10 mm in  3267200100031 
            diameter and 2.0 mm in spacing.                       3267200100032 
           The distances from the cathode to the grid, the grid   3267200100033 
            to the anode, and the anode to the shield were 44.0,  3267200100034 
            22.0 and 11.0 mm respectively.                        3267200100035 
           The working gas was Kr+2.89%CO2 and the pressure was   3267200100036 
            1.85 atm.                                             3267200100037 
           The high voltages for the cathode, the grids and the   3267200100038 
            anodes were -2000, 0 and +1600 V, respectively.       3267200100039 
           (FISCH) A small parallel plate 238U fission chamber    3267200100040 
            placed between the gridded ionization chamber and the 3267200100041 
            gas target was used for absolute neutron flux         3267200100042 
            determination.                                        3267200100043 
           The abundance of the 238U isotope was better than      3267200100044 
            99.997%.                                              3267200100045 
           The diameter and mass of the 238U sample were 2.0 cm   3267200100046 
            and 547.2 (1+-1.3%) ug, respectively.                 3267200100047 
           The working gas of the fission chamber was a flowing   3267200100048 
            Ar+3.73%CO2 gas with pressure slightly higher than    3267200100049 
            1.0 atm.                                              3267200100050
