INC-SPECT  Because of wide energy spread of the neutron beam,     3052400100010 
           the spectrum averaged values are used.                 3052400100011 
SAMPLE     The lead isotopes were brought onto quartz plates in   3052400100012 
           the isotope separator at the Institute of Nuclear      3052400100013 
           Research.  In this mass-separator, contamination with  3052400100014 
           neighbouring isotopes was less than 0.1%.              3052400100015 
           The relative values of the amount of lead isotopes were3052400100016 
           obtained by the microphotometer and the absolute ones  3052400100017 
           were determined by measuring backscattering of alpha   3052400100018 
           particles.                                             3052400100019
