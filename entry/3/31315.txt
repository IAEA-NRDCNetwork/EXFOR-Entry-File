SAMPLE     A cylindrical brass chamber, 19 cm in diam. and 6.6 cm 3131500100008 
           in height was filled with the gas under study at       3131500100009 
           atmospheric pressure. Natural neon gas consists of     3131500100010 
           90.92% 20Ne, 0.26% 21Ne and 8.82% 22Ne.                3131500100011

METHOD     Three exposures were made:                             3131500100013 
             a) with neon gas at atmospheric pressure,            3131500100014 
             b) with vacuum in the chamber which served as the    3131500100015 
                background for hydrogen as well as neon,          3131500100016 
             c) with hydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure which   3131500100017 
                served as the standard for determination of the   3131500100018 
                neon cross-section; this was also used as a check 3131500100019 
                on the geometry employed, by studying the known   3131500100020 
                energy and angular distributions of the recoil    3131500100021 
                protons.                                          3131500100022

               the cross-section measurement are 8.4% and 16.4%   3131500200009

COMMENT    Author's comment:"22Ne is only 9 % abundant and its    3131500200014 
           cross-section is expected to be only l/4th that of 20Ne3131500200015 
           hence its contribution to the cross-section given above3131500200016 
           is expected to be less than 2%. As such, the measured  3131500200017 
           cross-section is almost entirely for the 20Ne isotope."3131500200018
