COMMENT    The Kr and Xe precursors of Rb and Cs isotopes are     3096100100010 
             retained within the target and decay there. Therefore3096100100011 
             the yields measured for Rb and Cs isotopes are cumu- 3096100100012 
             lative. Since independent yields of Rb isotopes below3096100100013 
             A=93 and of Cs isotopes below A=143 (see Exfor30960) 3096100100014 
             are a small fraction of their cumulative yields, it  3096100100015 
             was not possible to calculate them with reasonable   3096100100016 
             accuracy. Instead, the obtained cumulative yields are3096100100017 
             presented here.                                      3096100100018

             The independent yields from this experiment and more 3096100100020 
             details are given in exfor30960. The information on  3096100100021 
             the cumulative yields is very brief and in Hebrew. It3096100100022 
             is assumed that the sample and method were the same  3096100100023 
             as in Exfor30960 and are partly reproduced here.     3096100100024 
           No information is given on analysis, error analysis and3096100100025 
             how absolute yields were obtained (monitor).         3096100100026 
             However, the yields (not the errors]) for Rb-91 and  3096100100027 
             Cs-139 are identical to literature values shown in   3096100100028
