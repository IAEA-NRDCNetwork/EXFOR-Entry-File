TITLE      Fission cross-section of Pu-239 at 13.1 To 15.4 MeV    3008400100006 
FACILITY   (VDG) neutrons were obtained from the T(d,n)He-4 reac- 3008400100007 
            tion by bombarding with deuterons accelerated to an   3008400100008 
            energy of 440 keV in Van-de-Graaff accelerator.       3008400100009 
INC-SOURCE (D-T),a thin titanium target (0.280 mg/cm2) in which   3008400100010 
            tritium gas was absorbed.                             3008400100011 
SAMPLE     Samples were made in the form of layers on disks of a  3008400100012 
            diameter of 6mm with the thickness of plutonium =     3008400100013 
             0.26 mg/cm2.                                         3008400100014 
METHOD     Counter ratio of U-238 and Pu-239 samples was          3008400100015 
            used.Plutonium samples were placed simultaneously at  3008400100016 
            various angles of neutron emission. Plutonium samples 3008400100017 
            along with the uranium samples were placed in shields 3008400100018 
            made from cadmium foil of a thickness of 0.5 mm.      3008400100019 
DETECTOR   (TRD) pieces of mica were used to detect fission       3008400100020 
            fragments.                                            3008400100021 
ANALYSIS    The ratio of the quantities of Pu-239 to those of     3008400100022 
            U-238 in the targets was obtained by measuring the    3008400100023 
            alpha-activity by semiconductor detector.The overall  3008400100024 
            error in the measurement of the quantity of Pu-239 was3008400100025 
            2 per cent, U-238 3 per cent.                         3008400100026

            Plutonium sigma fission  was  measured                3008400100028 
            relatively to that of U-238 and normalized to sigma   3008400100029
