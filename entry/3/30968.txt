SAMPLE      Cf-252 source with strength of 4*10**5 fissions/min   3096800100009 
           on an aluminum backing                                 3096800100010 
DETECTOR   (COIN,SIBAR,HPGE,NAICR) A silicon-surface-barrier      3096800100011 
           detector, detected the fission fragments, the HPGe     3096800100012 
           the K X-rays, and the NaI(Tl) detectors the gammas     3096800100013 
           low-energy threshold of both NaI(Tl) was 80 keV        3096800100014 
           the fission detector and the hpge detector were kept   3096800100015 
           at right angles to each other. Two NaI(Tl) detectors   3096800100016 
           were kept in a plane perpendicular to the direction    3096800100017 
           of the hpge and placed symmetrically with respect to   3096800100018 
           direction of fragment motion                           3096800100019
