FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) PD-300 neutron generator                32735  1   11 
SAMPLE     About 10 gram of Dy2O3 (99.995% purity) powder was     32735  1   12 
           pressed at 980 MPa, and thin 20 mm diameter samples    32735  1   13 
           were obtained. The samples were irradiated in contact  32735  1   14 
           with the target, sandwiched between standard Niobium   32735  1   15 
           foils (99.999% purity, 0.5 mm thick) of the same       32735  1   16 
           diameter utilized to monitor the neutron fluence via   32735  1   17 
           the 93Nb(n,2n)92mNb reaction.                          32735  1   18 
INC-SOURCE (D-T) A T-Ti target was used in the generator, with a  32735  1   19 
           thickness of 2.40 mg/cm2, and the diameter of the      32735  1   20 
           active zone was 12 mm. Neutrons were produced by the   32735  1   21 
           T(d,n)4He reaction with an effective deuteron beam     32735  1   22 
           energy of 134 keV and beam current of 260 uA.          32735  1   23 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma ray activities of 162Tb, 163Tb and    32735  1   24 
           93mNb were determined by a high-purity germanium       32735  1   25 
           detector (ORTEC, model GEM 60P, crystal diameter:      32735  1   26 
           70.1 mm, crystal length: 72.3 mm) with a relative      32735  1   27 
           efficiency of about 68% and an energy resolution of    32735  1   28 
           1.69 keV at 1.332 MeV for 60Co. The efficiency of the  32735  1   29 
           detector was measured using various standard gamma     32735  1   30 
           sources, namely Co-57, Co-60, Cd-109, Ba-133, Cs-137,  32735  1   31 
           Eu-152, Am-241 and Ra-226. Standard Reference          32735  1   32 
           Material QCR9110 was obtained from China Institute of  32735  1   33 
           Atomic Energy (CIAE), scope of activity is 3.04E4 to   32735  1   34 
           4.26E4 Bq.                                             32735  1   35 
           (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector was located  32735  1   36 
           at 135 degree to accompany the a-particle tube placed  32735  1   37 
           at a distance of 1.10 m from the target.               32735  1   38 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted about    32735  1   39 
           60 min with a yield about 3 to 4E10 n/(4pi*s). The     32735  1   40 
           groups of samples were placed at 0 degree or 135       32735  1   41 
           degree angles relative to the beam direction and were  32735  1   42 
           centered about the tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target at   32735  1   43 
           distances of about 40 mm.                              32735  1   44
