INC-SOURCE (D-D) The length and diameter of the deuterium gas     3269400100015 
           cell are 2.0 cm and 0.9 cm, respectively. The gas      3269400100016 
           cell was separated from the vacuum tube by a           3269400100017 
           molybdenum foil 5 mu-m in thickness. The deuterium     3269400100018 
           gas pressure range was about 3.1-2.9 atm.              3269400100019 
DETECTOR   (IOCH)A twin gridded ionization chamber was used as    3269400100020 
           the charged particle detector with forward and         3269400100021 
           backward asymmetrical sections. It has the advantages  3269400100022 
           of high detection efficiency (about 100%), large       3269400100023 
           detection solid angle (about 4Pi). The shape of the    3269400100024 
           chamber is cylindrical, with diameter 28.2 cm and      3269400100025 
           height 27.2 cm. The shape of electrodes is             3269400100026 
           rectangular and include one common cathode, two grids, 3269400100027 
           two anodes and two shields. For the forward section,   3269400100028 
           the distances from cathode to grid, grid to anode,     3269400100029 
           and anode to shield were 44.0, 22.0 and 11.0 mm,       3269400100030 
           respectively. For the backward section, they were      3269400100031 
           18.0, 9.0 and 11.0 mm, respectively. The working gas   3269400100032 
           of the ionization chamber was a Kr+2.89%CO2 mixture    3269400100033 
           at pressure of 1.10 atm. High voltages for the         3269400100034 
           cathode, grids and anodes were -1100, 0 and +900 V,    3269400100035 
           respectively.                                          3269400100036 
           (BF3)A BF3 long counter was used for neutron flux      3269400100037 
           monitoring and normalization. The axis of the BF3      3269400100038 
           long counter and the normal line of the electrodes of  3269400100039 
           the gridded ionization chamber were at 0 degree to     3269400100040 
           the beam line. The distance from the cathode of the    3269400100041 
           ionization chamber to the center of the neutron        3269400100042 
           source was 15.9 cm, and that from the front side of    3269400100043 
           the moderator of the BF3 long counter to the neutron   3269400100044 
           source was about 2.40 m.                               3269400100045 
SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.940) The thicknesses of the forward and  3269400100046 
           backward samples are 21.3 and 23.0 mu-g/cm2,           3269400100047 
           respectively, and the diameter of both 10B samples is  3269400100048 
           42.0 mm. Each 10B sample was vacuum evaporated on a    3269400100049 
           circular tantalum backing 48.0 mm in diameter and 100  3269400100050

COMMENT    The cross section values of monitor reaction were      3269400100065

           This paper is first time to report the information of  3269400100067 
           Leaking alpha. Usually, measure the Forward and        3269400100068 
           Backward alpha and sum of those two part contribution  3269400100069 
           as total (n,a) reaction. However, especially for the   3269400100070 
           target is light nuclei, the contribution of Leaking    3269400100071 
           alpha couldn't be ignored. As an example, the          3269400100072 
           contribution of Leaking alpha is 15.6% at 4 MeV in this3269400100073 
           measurement.                                           3269400100074
