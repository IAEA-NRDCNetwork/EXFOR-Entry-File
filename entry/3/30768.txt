            The efficiency for track registration in solution has 30768  1   21 
            been determined by comparison with another Lexan      30768  1   22

ANALYSIS   The total number of fissions was derived from the      30768  1   30 
            fission track density taking into account:            30768  1   31

            - efficiency for track registration in solution       30768  1   33 
            - concentration of target material in solution.       30768  1   34 
            Details are given in Nucl.Instr.Meth.Phys.Res.B24/25  30768  1   35 
           Fission yields are derived from measured activities    30768  1   36 
            and total number of fissions using a standard formula 30768  1   37 
            containing factors for decay during irradiation,      30768  1   38

           Compiler's comment: the formula does not account for   30768  1   40

COMMENT    by compiler: the following information pertinent to    30768  1   43 
           evaluators is missing or insufficient in the paper:    30768  1   44 
           - exact value of the neutron energy;                   30768  1   45 
           - duration of irradiation, cooling and measurements;   30768  1   46 
           - analysis of gamma-spectra: interfering peaks,        30768  1   47 
             uncertainties involved;                              30768  1   48 
           - genetic parent-daughter relationships; details on the30768  1   49 
             way yields were obtained;                            30768  1   50 
           - error analysis: types and numerical values of        30768  1   51 
             different error contributions involved/considered.   30768  1   52 
CRITIQUE   by compiler ML: In the following cases it is unclear   30768  1   53 
           what type of yield the values represent (or values are 30768  1   54 
           doubtful):                                             30768  1   55 
           1. Sb-126: shielded by 10E+5 year Sn-126               30768  1   56 
           2. Sb-128 has a metastable state which is fed by beta  30768  1   57 
              decay of Sn-128 but decays only to 3.6 % to Sb-128g.30768  1   58 
           3. Te-131m is fed only in 6.8 % of Sb-131 beta decays. 30768  1   59 
              The yield value given seems to be too high for the  30768  1   60 
              cumulative yield of the metastable state.           30768  1   61 
           These points need clarification.                       30768  1   62
