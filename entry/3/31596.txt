SAMPLE     Two identical tungsten foils (99.9% pure) with a       31596  1   13 
            size of 50.1 mm X50.1 mm X 0.138mm (6.644 g) to       31596  1   14 
            measure the Cd ratio at the same time of the          31596  1   15 
            irradiation.                                          31596  1   16 
           The thickness of the foil was calculated by dividing   31596  1   17 
            the mass of the foil by the area with a density of    31596  1   18 
            19.25 g/cm3.                                          31596  1   19 
           One foil was sandwiched by two cadmium foils of about  31596  1   20 
            1 mm thickness.                                       31596  1   21
