SAMPLE     Two identical tungsten foils (99.9% pure) with a       3159600100013 
            size of 50.1 mm X50.1 mm X 0.138mm (6.644 g) to       3159600100014 
            measure the Cd ratio at the same time of the          3159600100015 
            irradiation.                                          3159600100016 
           The thickness of the foil was calculated by dividing   3159600100017 
            the mass of the foil by the area with a density of    3159600100018 
            19.25 g/cm3.                                          3159600100019 
           One foil was sandwiched by two cadmium foils of about  3159600100020 
            1 mm thickness.                                       3159600100021
