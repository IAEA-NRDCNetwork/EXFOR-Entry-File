FACILITY   (REAC) Pakistan Research reactor-1 at PINSTECH.        3153300100008 
           The reactor core contains 20% LEU fuel.                3153300100009 
SAMPLE     The targets of the terbium were prepared from spectro- 3153300100010 
           graphically pure powder Tb4O7 from Merck. A small      3153300100011 
           quantity of terbium powder (2-6 mg) was spread onto    3153300100012 
           a Whatman-1 filter paper,covering a relatively large   3153300100013 
           circular foils of about 8-10 mm in diam. Four samples  3153300100014 
           were prepared for bare irradiation and another four    3153300100015 
           for irradiation under a cadmium cover. The weighing of 3153300100016 
           the target materials was carefully carried out using a 3153300100017 
           Sartorius semimicro electrical balance.                3153300100018 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma ray spectrometry of the irradiated    3153300100019 
           samples was carried out using a high-resolution        3153300100020 
           ganuna ray detection system. The system employed a     3153300100021 
           40% relative efficiency high purity germanium detector 3153300100022 
           with energy resolution of 2.0 keV at the 1332.5 keV    3153300100023 
           peak of 60Co. The induced activities in the terbium    3153300100024 
           samples were determined by measuring the y rays at     3153300100025 
           298, 879, and 1177 keV associated with the decay of    3153300100026 
           160Tb while counting the samples at source-detector    3153300100027 
           distances of 25 and 15 cm.                             3153300100028 
METHOD     (ACTIV)                                                3153300100029 
           The irradiations of the activation detectors of Au, Co,3153300100030 
           Mn, and Zn were carried out to characterize the neutron3153300100031 
           irradiation facility. The targets of Au weighing 1-4 mg3153300100032 
           were prepared from thin gold foils of thickness 30 mu-m3153300100033 
           The cobalt samples (6-10 mg) were made from 10-mil     3153300100034 
           cobalt wire.The wires were cut into roughly equal      3153300100035 
           pieces of length 2 cm and rolled spirally. The         3153300100036 
           manganese samples (2-4 mg) were made from manganese    3153300100037 
           metallicpieces. Zinc foils (approx.2 mg) of 8 mm diam. 3153300100038 
           were used. For the determination of the alpha deviation3153300100039 
           parameter, these activation detectors were packaged    3153300100040 
           together in standard polystyrene irradiation capsules  3153300100041 
           of dimension 13.5 mm in diameter and height 11 mm for  3153300100042 
           bare irradiation and another set of detectors was      3153300100043 
           packaged into a cadmium box of dimension 14 mm diam.,  3153300100044 
           height 6 mm, and thickness 1 mm. Each of the activation3153300100045 
           detectors was also encapsulated individually within    3153300100046 
           polystyrene and cadmium covers for the determination   3153300100047 
           of thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes and cadmium   3153300100048 
           ratios.                                                3153300100049 
CORRECTION Thermal and epithermal correction factors were used    3153300100050 
           in the determination of the thermal neutron capture    3153300100051 
           cross section (the cross section at 2200 m/sec)        3153300100052 
           and resonance integral (epithermal neutrons in the     3153300100053 
           1/E region) for the rare-earth nuclide Terbium-159.    3153300100054 
           Thermal and epithermal correction factors were         3153300100055 
           calculated by using the expression described by        3153300100056
