SAMPLE     Samples of natural titanium, chromium, iron, cobalt,   3097900100012 
           nickel and zinc, in the form of pure metallic or oxide 3097900100013 
           powder.                                                3097900100014 
           Al was in the form of aluminium oxide powder in order  3097900100015 
           to ensure uniform mixing with the sample powder.       3097900100016

INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a 0.6mg/    3097900100018 
           cm**2 thick Ti-T layer with 150 and 300 keV deuterons, 3097900100019 
           the first ones originating from (D2)+ molecules in the 3097900100020 
           deuteron beam which were accellerated by the same high 3097900100021 
           voltage as the atomic D+. Neutron energy was selected  3097900100022 
           by the angular position of the sample with respect to  3097900100023 
           the deuteron beam axis. The calculated neutron-energy  3097900100024 
           scale was verified by measuring the energy dependence  3097900100025 
           of the Nb-93(n,2n)Nb-92-m and Zr-90(n,2n)Zr-89-m+g     3097900100026 
           cross sections.                                        3097900100027

           by adding the uncertainty components in quadrature.    3097900100045 
           The total neutron energy spread was estimated taking   3097900100046 
           into account the kinetics of the neutron-producing     3097900100047 
           reaction, the deuteron energy loss in the Ti-T layer,  3097900100048

           by the sample.                                         3097900100051
