FACILITY   (VDG,3CPRBJG)Experiments were performed at the 4.5MV   3161700100009 
           Van de Graaff accelerator of Peking University         3161700100010 
DETECTOR   (IOCH)A gridded ionization chamber (GIC) was used as   3161700100011 
           the charged particle detector. It has the advantages   3161700100012 
           of high detection efficiency (close to 100%), large    3161700100013 
           detection solid angle (almost 2Pi), the ability of     3161700100014 
           particle energy and direction determination and the    3161700100015 
           potential of discrimination of different particles.    3161700100016 
           (BF3)A BF3 long counter was used as a neutron flux     3161700100017 
           monitor.                                               3161700100018 
SAMPLE     A 10B sample and a 238U foil were set back-to-back     3161700100019 
           at the common cathode. The 10B sample was evaporated   3161700100020 
           on a tantalum backing 4.8 cm in diameter and 50 mm     3161700100021 
           in thickness. The abundance of the 10B isotope was     3161700100022 
           94.0%. The mass of the 10B sample was 514 mu-g, and    3161700100023 
           the thickness was 34.7 mu-g/cm2. The mass and the      3161700100024 
           diameter of the 238U sample were 7.85+-0.10 mg and     3161700100025 
           4.50 cm, and the abundance of the 238U isotope was     3161700100026 
           99.999%.                                               3161700100027 
INC-SOURCE (D-D)Neutrons were produced through the D(d,n)3He      3161700100028 
           reaction with a deuterium gas target. The length of    3161700100029 
           the gas cell was 2.0 cm and the pressure of the        3161700100030 
           deuterium gas was 3.0-2.87 atm with a molybdenum       3161700100031 
           foil window 5 mm in thickness separated from the       3161700100032 
           vacuum tube. The energies of the deuteron beam         3161700100033 
           before enter the foil were 1.77 and 2.44 MeV, and      3161700100034 
           the neutron energies were 4.0 and 5.0 MeV, with        3161700100035 
           energy spreads 0.22 and 0.16 MeV, respectively. The    3161700100036 
           estimated neutron fluxes on the sample were 2.1x10**5  3161700100037 
           and 2.5x10**5 n/s/cm2 for the above-mentioned two      3161700100038 
           neutron energy measurements.                           3161700100039
