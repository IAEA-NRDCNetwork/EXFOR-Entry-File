INC-SOURCE (D-D) Monoenergetic neutrons were produced through     3267600100014 
           the D(d,n)3He reaction with a deuterium gas target,    3267600100015 
           2.0 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The gas cell  3267600100016 
           was separated from the vacuum tube by a molybdenum     3267600100017 
           foil 5 mu-m in thickness. The pressure range was       3267600100018 
           3.14x10**5-2.94x10**5 Pa. The energies of the deuteron 3267600100019 
           beam before enter the foil were 1.79, 2.46 and         3267600100020 
           3.26 MeV, and the neutron energies were 4.0, 5.0       3267600100021 
           and 6.0 MeV, with energy spreads 0.23, 0.16 and        3267600100022 
           0.12 MeV, respectively.                                3267600100023

           in diameter, and 2.0 mm in thickness.  The grids       3267600100026 
           were composed of gilded parallel tungsten wires,       3267600100027 
           0.10 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in spacing, and the     3267600100028 
           effective area is 16x18 cm2. Distances from the        3267600100029 
           cathode to grid and from the grid to anode were 75     3267600100030 
           and 20 mm, respectively. The working gas was           3267600100031 
           Kr + 2.89%CO2. The pressures of the working gas was    3267600100032 
           1.37x10**5 Pa.                                         3267600100033

           Two 95Mo samples (The thickness and diameter for each  3267600100038
