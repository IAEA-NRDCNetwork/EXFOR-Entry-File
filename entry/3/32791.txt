FACILITY   (VDGT,3CPRAEP) The HI-13 Tandem                        32791  1   10 
INC-SOURCE (D-T) The tritium gas chamber was of size 10 mm        32791  1   11 
           diameter X 40 mm thickness and made of stainless steel.32791  1   12 
           The chamber was filled with the purified tritium       32791  1   13 
           gas of 0.22 MPa. The deuteron energy was 6.0 MeV.      32791  1   14 
METHOD     (TOF) Time of flight technique was used to measure     32791  1   15 
           the neutron spectrum.                                  32791  1   16 
           (GSPEC) The gamma-ray spectra were recorded            32791  1   17 
           successively over a period of two months to encompass  32791  1   18 
           the wide range of half-life involved, and to           32791  1   19 
           eliminate the cross interfering of the gamma-rays      32791  1   20 
           from the product nuclides of almost the same energy,   32791  1   21 
           which can not be resolved by the HPGe detector.        32791  1   22 
           (ABSFY) Fission rate was monitored by fission chamber. 32791  1   23 
SAMPLE     (92-U-235,NAT=0.902) The samples used in the           32791  1   24 
           irradiation were 16 mm in diameter disks of uranium    32791  1   25 
           metal with isotopic composition of 234U (1.1%),        32791  1   26 
           235U (90.2%), 236U (0.3%), and 238U (8.4%).            32791  1   27 
           The uranium disk was sealed in a pure aluminum foil    32791  1   28 
           of 0.2 mm thickness.                                   32791  1   29 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) After the irradiation, the gamma-ray spectra    32791  1   30 
           of the samples were recorded directly by using HPGe    32791  1   31 
           gamma-ray spectrometer.                                32791  1   32 
           (FISCH) The sample sandwiched between two              32791  1   33 
           standardized thin samples was mounted in a double      32791  1   34 
           fission chamber, which covered with Cd of 1 mm         32791  1   35 
           thickness.                                             32791  1   36 
CORRECTION Corrections were made for the self-absorption of the   32791  1   37 
           gamma-rays, the cascade coincidence losses, the        32791  1   38 
           influence of background neutrons, the independent      32791  1   39 
           yields and the fission from 238U.                      32791  1   40 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties (1 sigma) of the yields were  32791  1   41 
           given by considering all known sources of random       32791  1   42 
           errors according to the error propagation law.         32791  1   43
