INC-SOURCE (P-LI7) Natural lithium with thickness of 3.2 mg/cm2   3309400100014 
           was sandwiched between two tantalum foils of           3309400100015 
           different thicknesses. The front tantalum foil facing  3309400100016 
           the proton beam was 3.9 mg/cm2 and the back tantalum   3309400100017 
           foil was 0.025 mm thick. Uncertainty assigned to       3309400100018

SAMPLE     Natural thorium and uranium metal foil (as flux        3309400100022 
           monitors) and natural nickel foil were used for the    3309400100023 
           neutron irradiation. The sizes of the U, Th, and Ni    3309400100024 
           square-shaped metal foils were 1.0 cm2. The U-Th-Ni    3309400100025 
           stack was mounted at 0 deg w.r.t the beam direction    3309400100026

METHOD     (ACTIV) The proton current during the irradiations     3309400100031

ANALYSIS   The two monitors (cross section for the fission        3309400200005 
           yield of 97Zr in 232Th and cross section for the       3309400200006 
           fission yield of 97Zr in 238U), were used to obtain    3309400200007 
           two ratios at each of the three effective neutron      3309400200008 
           energies along with covariance information, which was  3309400200009 
           further used to obtain the evaluated values of the     3309400200010
