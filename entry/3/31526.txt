COMMENT    By compiler (ML): These measurements were performed    3152600100015 
           to test the radiochemical method used for fast fission 3152600100016 
           yield mesurements (see EXFOR31525), and are regarded   3152600100017 
           only as byproduct of the fast yield experiment.        3152600100018 
           However, it can be assumed, that the detector and      3152600100019 
           method are the same as for fast yields, although       3152600100020 
           no information on METHOD, DETECTOR or ANALYSIS is      3152600100021
