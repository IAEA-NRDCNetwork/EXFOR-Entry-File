           previously calibrated with an standard 152Eu source.   3154800100016

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relative uncertainty is                 3154800100036 
           due to two kinds of errors:                            3154800100037 
             * the correction for the activation by epithermal    3154800100038 
               neutrons, 1.9% of the cross section, and other     3154800100039 
               smaller contributions, like time measurements      3154800100040 
               and counting statistics.                           3154800100041 
             * the emission probability of the 312-keV gamma ray, 3154800100042 
               1.0% relative standard deviation, followed by the  3154800100043 
               relative precision in the Au cross section used as 3154800100044 
               the monitor, 0.3%.                                 3154800100045 
            The uncertainty due to the efficiency calibration is  3154800100046 
            almost negligible because the final result depends    3154800100047 
            only on the relative efficiency of the 312 keV from   3154800100048 
            233Pa and 411 keV from 198Au decay gamma rays.        3154800100049
