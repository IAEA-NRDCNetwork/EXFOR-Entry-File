SAMPLE     The sample was made of 99.99% purity U3O8 powder with  3270900100017 
           a diameter of 5 mm, and sandwiched between two disks   3270900100018 
           made of thin Co foils. The high-purity (99.999%) Co    3270900100019 
           monitors had diameters of 5 mm and thicknesses of 0.2  3270900100020 
           mm.                                                    3270900100021 
DETECTOR  1(HPGE) A HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer consisting of an  3270900100022 
           ORTEC GEM35-PLU HPGe detector (sensitive volume 110    3270900100023 
           cm3), an ORTEC DESPEC-PLUS analyzer, and a PC          3270900100024

           rays from 59Co(n,2n)58Co reaction were measured with   3270900100026 
           this system. The system has an energy resolution of    3270900100027 
           1.83 keV and a relative efficiency of 47% (both are    3270900100028 
           for 1.33 MeV gamma ray).                               3270900100029 
           (SIBAR) An Au-Si surface barrier detector was          3270900100030

           (MCPLT) The secondary electrons induced by the         3270900100036 
           incoming ions at a 7 ug/cm2 carbon foil (with a        3270900100037 
           diameter of 30 mm) were reflected by an electrostatic  3270900100038 
           mirror, collected and multiplied by the MCPLT.         3270900100039

          2(TOF) The TOF system consisted of a microchannel       3270900100043 
           plate (start detector) and a gold-silicon surface      3270900100044 
           barrier detector (stop detector). The two detectors    3270900100045 
           were separated by a flight path of 1.8 m.              3270900100046 
           (AMS) This facility is based on an HI-13 accelerator   3270900100047 
           equipped with a cesium sputter ion source. The         3270900100048 
           dedicated injector is composed of a 90 degree          3270900100049 
           spherical electrostatic analyzer (SESA), a 112 degree  3270900100050 
           double focusing analyzing magnet (DFMA) and some ion-  3270900100051 
           optical elements. The SESA has a curvature radius of   3270900100052 
           750 mm and maximum electric field strength of 4 kV/cm. 3270900100053

STATUS     (TABLE) All measured reactions data and monitor        3270900100085

COMMENT    The uncertainties in incident neutron energies are     3270900100087 
           included in neither the uncertainty of the neutron     3270900100088 
           flux nor the cross-section values in the experiment.   3270900100089 
           Since neither neutron source nor sample is a           3270900100090 
           geometrical "point", neutron energy dispersion is      3270900100091 
           inevitable in any experiment. Users of cross-section   3270900100092 
           values may therefore be aware of the uncertainty in    3270900100093 
           incident neutron energy. (Commented by author)         3270900100094
