TITLE      Determination of independent yields of I131 and I133   3094600100006

FACILITY   No information given, but the compiler assumes that the3094600100009 
           irradiations were done at the IRR-1 swimming pool type 3094600100010 
           reactor at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center.          3094600100011 
METHOD     (RCHEM) 2 methods were employed:                       3094600100012 
            1) The apparent direct yields of I-133,I-134 and I-1353094600100013 
               were obtained by selective labelling;              3094600100014 
            2) the respective cumulative yields by conventional   3094600100015 
               wet radiochemistry.                                3094600100016

ANALYSIS   The amounts obtained by method 1) were expressed as    3094600100018 
           fractions of those obtained by method 2), giving the   3094600100019 
           apparent fractional independent yield. The real        3094600100020 
           independent yields were obtained by extrapolation of   3094600100021 
           the apparent fractional yields to zero time after      3094600100022 
           irradiation.                                           3094600100023

ANALYSIS   The assumed values were used for conversion of the     3094600300012 
           measured values to independent fission yields.         3094600300013 
           Compilers note: since the yields were obtained from    3094600300014 
           relative activities of iodine fission product isotopes,3094600300015 
           all assumed values were used for the complete          3094600300016 
           analysis of raw data.                                  3094600300017 
COMMENT    by commpiler: apparently was the independent yield of  3094600300018 
           I-134 used to normalize the measured relative direct   3094600300019 
           yields obtained by method 1). It was calculated from   3094600300020 
           the fractional independent yield given by Wahl         3094600300021 
            (ASSUM3) and the I-134 cumulative yield by Katcoff.   3094600300022
