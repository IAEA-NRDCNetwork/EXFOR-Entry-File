INC-SOURCE (P-T) Proton beam energy is 5.2 MeV. The proton beam   3280600100011 
           current was close to 35 uA and focused to bombard      3280600100012 
           solid tritium-titanium (T-Ti) target. The T-Ti target  3280600100013 
           has a thickness of 1.833 mg/cm2 and the atom ratio of  3280600100014 
           T to Ti is 1.84. Tantalum foil is behind the T-Ti      3280600100015 
           target which could stop the proton beam. At the end    3280600100016 
           of the target, a continuous cooling water flow with a  3280600100017 
           thickness of 4 mm was used to avoid local overheating. 3280600100018 
SAMPLE     Four disc-shaped samples with a diameter of 20 mm and  3280600100019 
           15 mm were made of ThO2 powder with a purity of more   3280600100020 
           than 99.9%, the area of sample 1 is 3.142 cm2 and the  3280600100021 
           area of all other sample is 1.767 cm2. The masses of   3280600100022 
           the four samples are 1.501 g, 1.233 g, 1.199 g and     3280600100023 
           1.288 g, which the mass thickness(tm) of samples are   3280600100024 
           0.478 g/cm2,0.698 g/cm2, 0.679 g/cm2 and 0.729 g/cm2.  3280600100025 
           These ThO2 samples were initially sandwiched between   3280600100026 
           two Au foils and then covered with 0.3 mm thick        3280600100027 
           cadmium. The Au foils (same diameter with thorium      3280600100028 
           samples and 0.1 mm thickness) were used to determine   3280600100029 
           the average neutron flux by 197Au(n,g)198Au reaction.  3280600100030 
           Meanwhile, the Cd box with high thermal neutron        3280600100031 
           capture cross-section was used for eliminating the     3280600100032 
           impact of scattered slow-thermal neutrons. The first   3280600100033 
           three samples were installed at 3.5 cm from the        3280600100034 
           center of the T-Ti target and at 0, 45 and 90 deg      3280600100035 
           angles to the proton beam, respectively. The last one  3280600100036 
           was mounted at 690 cm and 90 deg angle, which was      3280600100037 
           used to determine the contribution of the background   3280600100038 
           neutron in whole hall.                                 3280600100039 
METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC) The irradiation lasted for 6 h. The Au   3280600100040 
           foils were cooled for 2-3 h then placed into detector  3280600100041 
           to get gamma-ray spectra to further calculate the      3280600100042 
           average neutron fluence. The irradiated targets of Th  3280600100043 
           were cooled more time (1-2 days) and detected enough   3280600100044 
           time for getting as many statistics as possible.       3280600100045 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The gamma-ray spectra of these irradiated       3280600100046 
           samples were detected with a low-background coaxial    3280600100047 
           high-purity germanium detector (GEM30P4-76, ORTEC).    3280600100048 
           The detector has a relative efficiency of 30% and an   3280600100049 
           energy resolution of 850 eV FWHM at 122 KeV and 1.85   3280600100050 
           KeV FWHM at 1.33 MeV.                                  3280600100051 
           (BF3) The neutron flux fluctuation was monitored with  3280600100052 
           a BF3 long counter that was placed at an another 45    3280600100053 
           deg angle and 481 cm from the target.                  3280600100054
