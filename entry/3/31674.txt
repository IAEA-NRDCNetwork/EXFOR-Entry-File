DETECTOR   (HE3SP) Two arrays of 3He proportional counters with   3167400100010 
           diameters 125 and 190 mm respectively, are imbedded    3167400100011 
           in a cylindrical polyethylene moderator 405 mm in      3167400100012 
           diam. and 420 mm in length, h, around a centra] hole   3167400100013 
           76 mm in diam.. The first array consists of six 10-atm 3167400100014 
           counters of the LND type and the second one - of twelve3167400100015 
           SNM-18 3-atm counters. Each counter is served by its   3167400100016 
           own preampiifier and discriminator.                    3167400100017 
           The detector efficicncy in registering neutrons for    3167400100018 
           these two cases was 28.4+-0.6% and 34.2+-0.8%,         3167400100019
