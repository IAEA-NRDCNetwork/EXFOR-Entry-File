AUTHOR     (S.Amiel,T.Izak-Biran)                                 3096500100007

           fission spectrum with average energy of 1.9 MeV.       3096500100011 
METHOD     no information as original source of data is unknown   3096500100012 
COMMENT    Compiler's (ML) comment: the origin of the yield value 3096500100013 
           compiled by B.F.Rider and included here is not clear:  3096500100014 
           - The Rider file contains the value given in the data  3096500100015 
             table (Subentry 2) associated with the reference     3096500100016 
             74AMI2.                                              3096500100017 
           - The Rider reference files gives under 74AMI2: 'Amiel,3096500100018 
             S., Izak-Biran,T., To be published (1974). Cited in  3096500100019 
             74AMI1.'                                             3096500100020 
           - For 74AMI1 the Rider reference file states: 'Amiel,  3096500100021 
             S., Feldstein, H., "Odd-Even Systematics in Neutron  3096500100022 
             Fission Yields of Uranium Isotopes 233 and 235",     3096500100023 
             submitted to Phys.Rev.C (July 1974). See 75AMI1'.    3096500100024 
           - For 75AMI1 the Rider reference file gives Phys.Rev.C 3096500100025 
             11(1975)845 (which is taken as the main reference for3096500100026 
             this entry).                                         3096500100027 
           Compiler (ML) assumes that 74AMI1 and 75AMI1 are the   3096500100028 
           same reference.                                        3096500100029 
           - Table IV of Phys.Rev.C 11(1975)845 contains the same 3096500100030 
             value as the Rider file; therefore it is used as the 3096500100031 
             main reference for this entry.                       3096500100032 
           - This table contains a footnote b) to the fractional  3096500100033 
             yield value giving 'Reference 31' as its origin.     3096500100034 
             Reference 31 is given as: 'S.Amiel and T.Izak-Biran, 3096500100035 
             Nucl.Sci.Eng. (to be published)'.                    3096500100036 
           The compiler (ML) identified this reference as:        3096500100037 
           T.Izak-Biran and S.Amiel, "Reevaluation of the Emission3096500100038 
           Probabilities of Delayed Neutrons from Fission         3096500100039 
           Products", Nucl.Sci.Eng. 57(1975)117. (There is no     3096500100040 
           other paper by these authors in Nucl.Sci.Eng. during   3096500100041 
           the years 1974-1976). However:                         3096500100042 
           - this reference presents an evaluation of delayed     3096500100043 
             neutron yields. All data presented are evaluated or  3096500100044 
             taken from another source.                           3096500100045 
           - It contains for fast fission only delayed neutron    3096500100046 
             group yields (Table III) but no yields for individual3096500100047 
             precursors and hence none for Br-87.                 3096500100048 
           - Even if one assumes that the group 1 consists only of3096500100049 
             Br-87, the delayed neutron yield (for 10% odd-even   3096500100050 
             effect) of 4.8, divided by the given Pn-value of 2.353096500100051 
             for Br-87, gives a cumulative yield of 2.04, which,  3096500100052 
             divided by the chain yield of 2.55 (given in Table IV3096500100053 
             of Phys.Rev.C 11(1975)845 along with the fractional  3096500100054 
             cumulative yield of 0.87), gives a fractional        3096500100055 
             cumulative yield of 0.80.                            3096500100056 
           Conclusions:                                           3096500100057 
           - Nucl.Sci.Eng. 57(1975)117 is not the source of the   3096500100058 
             compiled value.                                      3096500100059 
           - It is even not known whether the value is the result 3096500100060 
             of an experiment and whether it originates from this 3096500100061 
             laboratory.                                          3096500100062 
           Therefore it is recommended not to use that value in an3096500100063 
           evaluation without any further information on, or      3096500100064 
           confirmation of, its origin and nature.                3096500100065
