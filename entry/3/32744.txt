FACILITY   (NGEN,3CPRNPC) K-400 intense neutron generator         3274400100011 
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons around 14 MeV were produced with a      3274400100012 
           deuteron beam of 270-280 keV and beam current of 350   3274400100013 
           uA. The solid T-Ti target used in the generator was    3274400100014 
           about 2.19 mg/cm2 thick.                               3274400100015 
SAMPLE     (22-TI-46,NAT=0.0825) Natural Titanium foils of        3274400100016 
           99.99% purity and 2.98-3.0 mm thickness were made      3274400100017 
           into circular samples with a diameter of 2.0 cm. Each  3274400100018 
           of them was sandwiched between disks of thin Niobium   3274400100019 
           of the same diameter, all the Niobium foils with       3274400100020 
           purities better than 99.99% and 1 mm thickness.        3274400100021 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) A well-calibrated GEM-60P coaxial high-purity   3274400100022 
           germanium ORTEC detector (crystal diameter 70.1 mm,    3274400100023 
           crystal length 72.3 mm) with a relative efficiency of  3274400100024 
           about 68% and an energy resolution of about 1.69 keV   3274400100025 
           FWHM at 1.332 MeV for 60Co was used to study the       3274400100026 
           gamma-activities of irradiated samples. The efficiency 3274400100027 
           of the detector was pre-calibrated using various       3274400100028 
           standard gamma sources.                                3274400100029 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Irradiation of the samples was lasted for 6.5- 3274400100030 
           7.5 h with a yield of about 4 to 5E10 n/s. The neutron 3274400100031 
           flux was monitored by the accompanying alpha-particles.3274400100032 
           Groups of samples were placed at 0, 45 and 90 degree   3274400100033 
           angles relative to the deuteron beam direction and     3274400100034 
           centered about the T-Ti target at a distance of about  3274400100035 
           3-5 cm. Two measurements have been done for the        3274400100036 
           characteristic 1157.02 keV gamma-line. First           3274400100037 
           measurement was carried out after the irradiated       3274400100038 
           samples were cooled for about 20-30 min (28 min),      3274400100039 
           and the second measurement was carried out after the   3274400100040 
           cooling time of about 9.4 times the half-life of       3274400100041 
           44gSc (78.73 h).                                       3274400100042
