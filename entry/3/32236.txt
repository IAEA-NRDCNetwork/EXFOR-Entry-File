COMMENT    A.O.Kadenko (2016-03-23):                              32236  1   13 
            The  cross sections for three (n,a) reactions at      32236  1   14 
             14.7 MeV compiled in this entry and those compiled in32236  1   15 
             EXFOR 32219 are from the same experiment.            32236  1   16 
            En=14.7+/-0.2 MeV is correct though it is printed as  32236  1   17 
            14.6+/-0.2 MeV in the article.                        32236  1   18

            Two papers(PR/C,81,014610,2010 and 2012KYIV,,444,2013)32236  1   20 
             are from two experiments. The 2010 paper describes   32236  1   21 
             the measurements performed for my PhD thesis. Then   32236  1   22 
             in 2012 Artem Kadenko with me as coauthor repeated   32236  1   23 
             one of the experiments on Lu and Tb.                 32236  1   24

            It is not very clear if 159Tb,175Lu and 176Lu(n,a)    32236  1   26 
             cross sections in two entries (32219 and this entry) 32236  1   27 
             are from the same experiment. The values of the      32236  1   28 
             cross sections and their uncertainties show perfect  32236  1   29 
             agreement between them but with different energies   32236  1   30 
             (En=14.6 MeV in 32219, 14.7 MeV in this EXFOR entry).32236  1   31
