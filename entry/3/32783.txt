INC-SOURCE (D-D) The neutrons were generated using deuteron beam  32783  1   12 
           to bombard a deuterium gas target in pressure 0.30     32783  1   13 
           MPa, the intensity of the deuteron beam was about 2.5  32783  1   14 
           uA and the length of the target gas cell was 2.0 cm.   32783  1   15 
           The deuterium gas target was separated from the        32783  1   16 
           vacuum tube of the accelerator by a molybdenum         32783  1   17 
           membrane 5.0 um in thickness. The gas target was       32783  1   18 
           cooled by a compressed air jet.                        32783  1   19 
DETECTOR   (IOCH) A twin-gridded ionization chamber was used as   32783  1   20 
           the charged particle detector. The distances from      32783  1   21 
           cathode to grid and anode to grid were 6.1 and 1.5     32783  1   22 
           cm, respectively. The working gas Kr+CO2(2.7%)         32783  1   23 
           pressures were 0.052 MPa for 4.0-5.0 MeV region and    32783  1   24 
           0.068 MPa for 5.5-6.0 MeV region, respectively.        32783  1   25 
           (BF3) A BF3 long counter located at 0 degree with      32783  1   26 
           respect to the deuteron beam axis was used to          32783  1   27 
           monitor the relative neutron fluence. The outer        32783  1   28 
           radius of the BF3 long counter was 27 mm and its       32783  1   29 
           length was 300 mm. The BF3 long counter was            32783  1   30 
           surrounded by a moderator with radius of 350 mm and    32783  1   31 
           length of 400 mm, and a cadmium plate 0.5 mm in        32783  1   32 
           thickness was mounted at the front face of the         32783  1   33 
           counter. The distance between the front face of the    32783  1   34 
           BF3 long counter and the center of the gas target was  32783  1   35 
           about 3.0 m.                                           32783  1   36 
SAMPLE     (12-MG-25,ENR=0.986) The material of the 25Mg sample   32783  1   37 
           is 25MgO. The sample radius was 22.0 mm. The 25Mg      32783  1   38 
           nucleus number of forward and backward direction were  32783  1   39 
           1.623 x E20 (+-5%) and 1.580 x E20 (+- 5%),            32783  1   40 
           respectively. The tantalum backing layers with 0.1 mm  32783  1   41 
           thick were faced with each other.                      32783  1   42
