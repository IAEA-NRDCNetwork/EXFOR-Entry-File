INC-SOURCE (D-T) A 25 MeV collimated beam of neutrons produced by 3097300100010 
           bombarding a Ti-T target with a 8 MeV pulsed deuteron  3097300100011 
           beam.                                                  3097300100012

           Two MWPC's, one placed behind the entrance- and one    3097300100015 
           before the exit-window of the deuterium gas cell, pro- 3097300100016 
           vided anticoincidence and coincidence signals respec-  3097300100017 
           tively to the telescope scintillators as to ensure     3097300100018 
           that all signals have their origin within the gas cell.3097300100019 
           The distance (flight path) between the two telescope   3097300100020 
           scintillation counters (delta-E and stop-detector) was 3097300100021 
           42.3 cm.                                               3097300100022 
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) The tritons are distinguished from other     3097300100023 
           particles by time-of flight between both scintillator  3097300100024 
           detectors and by the energy deposit in the stop-       3097300100025 
           detector.                                              3097300100026 
MONITOR    In order to separate the 25 MeV neutrons from the      3097300100027

           spectrum the time between the signal of the pulsing    3097300100029 
           system and that of the delta-E-scintillator was        3097300100030 
           measured. By setting a time window the 25 MeV neutrons 3097300100031 
           were selected.                                         3097300100032 
ANALYSIS   The area of the tritons in the TOF versus energy spec- 3097300100033 
           trum overlaps sligthly that of the deuterons. In order 3097300100034 
           to evaluate the number of measured tritons the events  3097300100035 
           of equal-time distance to the deuteron band were       3097300100036 
           summed up. The number of tritons was evaluated from    3097300100037 
           a 6-parameter fit for the resulting triton and deu-    3097300100038 
           teron distributions.                                   3097300100039
