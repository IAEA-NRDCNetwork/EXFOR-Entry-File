INC-SOURCE (D-D) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a deuterium 3140300100010 
           gas cell ( 4.3 atm.) with a 7.4 MeV pulsed deuteron    3140300100011 
           beam.                                                  3140300100012 
SAMPLE     Natural uranium electro-deposited on both sides of     3140300100013 
           0.2 mm thick plates of stainless steel with deposition 3140300100014 
           thickness of about 0.5 mg/cm**2.                       3140300100015 
DETECTOR   (IOCH,SCIN) Fission fragments were detected by a       3140300100016 
           parallel-plate ionization chamber which operated in    3140300100017 
           multi-segment mode and was filled with pure methane at 3140300100018 
           a pressure of 4.3 atm. Fission neutrons were detected  3140300100019 
           by two shielded liquid scintillators of 25 cm in diam. 3140300100020 
           5 cm thick. Both placed at 100 degrees with respect    3140300100021 
           to the incident neutron beam and at 2.3 m from the     3140300100022 
           ionization chamber.                                    3140300100023 
METHOD     (TOF,COINC,PSD)  The incident-neutron TOF spectrum was 3140300100024 
           obtained from the fission-fragment event signals with  3140300100025 
           the pulsed-beam TOF method. A liquid scintillator,     3140300100026 
           located at 0 deg and 3.1 m down stream of the gas cell 3140300100027 
           served as monitor of the incident-neutron tof spectrum.3140300100028 
           Fission neutrons were selected by requiring coincidence3140300100029 
           between neutron detector-  and fission-fragment detec- 3140300100030 
           tor events, which also provided the fission-neutron TOF3140300100031 
           spectra. Events induced by 10 MeV incident neutrons    3140300100032 
           were software selected by gating the TOF spectrum of   3140300100033 
           secundary neutrons with the 10 MeV peak of the incident3140300100034 
           neutron spectrum. Pulse-shape discrimination was       3140300100035 
           applied to eliminate gamma-ray background.             3140300100036 
ANALYSIS   The measured spectrum was fitted by a Maxwellian       3140300100037 
           distribution.                                          3140300100038
