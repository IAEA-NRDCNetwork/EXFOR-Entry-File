INC-SOURCE (REAC) Irradiations were performed in the pneumatic    3149900100009 
           rabbit facility of the High Flux Australian Reactor.   3149900100010 
           In this facility, the radioactive target could be      3149900100011 
           sent-to or received-from reactor within 30 sec.        3149900100012 
           Neutron flux was at 5*10E+13 n/(sec*cm2).              3149900100013 
INC-SPECT  Thermal spectrum, no details given                     3149900100014 
SAMPLE     Prior to irradiation, >95% of Re-188 was chemically    3149900100015 
           removed from the target.                               3149900100016 
           W-188 content of target was 52.6 MBq.                  3149900100017 
           Irradiation time was 10 min.                           3149900100018 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Based on a knowlege of the W-188 content of    3149900100019 
           target, neutron flux density, irradiation time and     3149900100020 
           with the assumption of 100% intensity for 260.1 and    3149900100021 
           420.5 KeV gamma rays, cross-section was calculated     3149900100022 
           for burn-up of W-188.                                  3149900100023 
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma-spectorscopy was performed using          3149900100024 
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector coupled to a PC-based       3149900100025 
           multichannel analyzer EG&G Ortec. Samples were placed  3149900100026 
           at 10-20 cm from the detector with dead times of       3149900100027 
           up to 20%.                                             3149900100028
