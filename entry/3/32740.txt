INC-SOURCE (D-T)The neutrons with the yield of about 1 to 3E12    32740  1   11 
           n/s, were produced by d-T reaction with an effective   32740  1   12 
           deuteron beam energy and current of 125 keV and 20     32740  1   13 
           mA. The thickness of the tritium-titanium (T-Ti)       32740  1   14 
           target was 0.9 mg/cm2.                                 32740  1   15 
SAMPLE     (82-PB-206,NAT=0.241) The natural lead foils of        32740  1   16 
           99.99% purity and 0.25 mm thickness were made into     32740  1   17 
           circular samples with a diameter of 20 mm. Each of     32740  1   18 
           them was sandwiched between natural niobium foils of   32740  1   19 
           the same diameter, all the niobium foils with          32740  1   20 
           purities better than 99.9% and 0.2 mm in thickness.    32740  1   21 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma-ray activities of the residual nuclei     32740  1   22 
           were measured by a CH8403 coaxial HPGe detector with   32740  1   23 
           sensitive volume 110 cm3 and relative efficiency of    32740  1   24 
           20% and energy resolution of 3 keV at 1.33 MeV.        32740  1   25 
           (FISCH) Used to monitor the neutron yield fluctuation. 32740  1   26 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The Lead samples were measured after having    32740  1   27 
           been cooled for more than 18 times of the half-life    32740  1   28 
           of Pb-203g (51.873 h) to avoid the effect of the       32740  1   29 
           gamma-ray (279.1967 keV) from Pb-203g.                 32740  1   30
