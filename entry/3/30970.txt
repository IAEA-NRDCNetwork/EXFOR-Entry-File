INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by bombarding a tritium   3097000100010 
           target with 5.5 MeV pulsed deuterons. For the analyzing3097000100011 
           power measurements the neutron reaction angle selected 3097000100012 
           was 20 deg, providing an incident beam of polarized    3097000100013 
           neutrons                                               3097000100014

METHOD     (REC,PSD,PHD) The sensitivity of the pulse height and  3097000100017 
           pulse shape outputs to the direction of the recoil     3097000100018 
           proton relative to the axes of the anthracene crystal  3097000100019 
           was utilized to measure left-right asymmetries of the  3097000100020 
           recoil protons.                                        3097000100021 
ANALYSIS   The asymmetry and the associated neutron C.M.          3097000100022 
           scattering angle were determined from the pulse height 3097000100023 
           and pulse shape outputs of the detected recoil protons.3097000100024 
           An additional scintillator detector was placed at      3097000100025 
           different laboratory angles with respect to the beam   3097000100026 
           axis to detect scattered neutrons coincident with the  3097000100027 
           anthracene crystal signals. Coincident events, which   3097000100028 
           formed a small part of the scatters recorded by the an-3097000100029 
           thracene were tagged out throughout the experiment and 3097000100030 
           formed the basis for the calibration of the measurement3097000100031 
           of the neutron scattering angle from the pulse height  3097000100032 
           and pulse shape data.                                  3097000100033 
           The final asymmetry values are weighted averages of    3097000100034 
           results from four independent experimental runs.       3097000100035 
CORRECTION Corrections have been made for the effects of recoil   3097000100036 
           proton escape from the crystal on the measurements,    3097000100037 
           and for instrumental asymmetries which were determined 3097000100038 
           from null polarization data collected using the        3097000100039
