SAMPLE     The enriched isotope of Gd-160 was obtained from the   3092800100008 
            Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA, in the form of    3092800100009

           The samples were prepared within a 1.6 cm dia. perspex 3092800100011

           Neutrons of 0.46, 0.57, and 0.75 MeV were obtained     3092800100025 
            from the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction, and neutrons of      3092800100026 
            0.97, 1.22, 1.52, 2.22, and 3.05 MeV were obtained    3092800100027

           Lithium targets with a thickness of 300 ug/cm**2 were  3092800100029 
            prepared by vacuum evaporation on a thin tantalum     3092800100030 
            backing.                                              3092800100031 
           A very thin gold layer, a few ug/cm**2, was deposited  3092800100032 
            on the top of lithium. The tritium targets were       3092800100033 
            comprised of 12 and 16 Curie tritium absorbed in a    3092800100034

METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample was placed between two standard         3092800100037 
            samples of K-I of similar size.                       3092800100038 
           Neutron flux at the place of irradiation was found to  3092800100039 
            be in the order of 10E+7 neutrons/cm**2/sec.          3092800100040

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) There are three factors that have been        3092800100044 
            considered in order to determine the uncertainty      3092800100045 
            associated with the given neutron energy.             3092800100046 
           One of them is the finite energy spread in the proton  3092800100047 
            energy before it strikes the target.                  3092800100048 
           The second main factor is the degradation of the       3092800100049 
            incident proton-beam energy in the target.            3092800100050 
           The third factor is the solid angle subtended by the   3092800100051 
            sample of the neutron source.                         3092800100052 
           Total neutron-energy spread 200-150 keV from           3092800100053 
            1. Energy spread in the proton beam 20 keV.           3092800100054 
            2. Degradation of incident beam in the T target 210   3092800100055 
               to 140 keV for a proton-beam energy of between 1   3092800100056 
               and 3 MeV. The corresponding neutron-energy spread 3092800100057 
               lies between 190 and 130 keV.                      3092800100058 
            3. Angle subtended by the sample at the neutron       3092800100059 
               source 22 - 55 keV.                                3092800100060 
           (ERR-T) The cross-section errors contain statistical   3092800100061 
            and systematic uncertainties, including the           3092800100062 
            uncertainty in the cross section of the standard      3092800100063 
            reaction.                                             3092800100064 
           Error in the decay properties were not taken into      3092800100065
