           Neutrons of 0.46, 0.57, and 0.75 MeV were obtained     3092800100022 
            from the Li-7(p,n)Be-7 reaction, and neutrons of      3092800100023 
            0.97, 1.22, 1.52, 2.22, and 3.05 MeV were obtained    3092800100024

           Lithium targets with a thickness of 300 ug/cm**2 were  3092800100026 
            prepared by vacuum evaporation on a thin tantalum     3092800100027 
            backing.                                              3092800100028 
           A very thin gold layer, a few ug/cm**2, was deposited  3092800100029 
            on the top of lithium. The tritium targets were       3092800100030 
            comprised of 12 and 16 Curie tritium absorbed in a    3092800100031 
            titanium layer on a thin copper backing having a      3092800100032 
            thickness of 0.25 mm.                                 3092800100033 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Sample was placed between two standard         3092800100034 
            samples of K-I of similar size.                       3092800100035 
           Neutron flux at the place of irradiation was found to  3092800100036 
            be in the order of 10E+7 neutrons/cm**2/sec.          3092800100037
