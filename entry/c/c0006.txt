ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,3.5,10.) The counting errors at the lowest   C0006002    4 
           energies are about three percent, and at the higher    C0006002    5 
           energies are negligible, The geometry of the counter   C0006002    6 
           used at low energies is known within about nine        C0006002    7 
           percent; for the other counter it is better known to   C0006002    8 
           about two percent. The current measurements with the   C0006002    9 
           integrator are probably good to two percent. The       C0006002   10 
           error due to the presence of neutral particles in the  C0006002   11

           percent. The bombarding voltage is known within one    C0006002   15 
           percent. The combination of these factors leads to an  C0006002   16
