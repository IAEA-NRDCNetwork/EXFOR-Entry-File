SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with thickness of 376 mg/cm2       C2656  1   11 
           was located at the target position of S800             C2656  1   12

METHOD     (EDE,COINC) Coincidence between focal plane            C2656  1   14 
           detector and gamma ray array GRETINA was required.     C2656  1   15 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Charged particle reaction products were        C2656  1   16 
           momentum-analyzed in S800 spectrograph                 C2656  1   17 
           (TELES,DRFTC,IOCH,SCIN) Reaction residues were         C2656  1   18 
           identified in focal plane detector, consisting of      C2656  1   19 
           two drift chambers, ionization chamber and four        C2656  1   20 
           plastic scintillation detectors.                       C2656  1   21

           the reaction products was detected using high-         C2656  1   23 
           resolution GRETINA gamma-ray array. GRETINA detector   C2656  1   24 
           consist of four 36-fold segmented high-purity          C2656  1   25 
           germanium detectors, grouped into modules of four      C2656  1   26 
           crystals each. The 11 GRETINA modules available at     C2656  1   27 
           the time of the experiment were arranged in two        C2656  1   28 
           rings with 4 modules located at 58deg and the other    C2656  1   29 
           7 modules at 90deg with respect to the beam axis.      C2656  1   30 
INC-SOURCE The secondary 68Co beam was produced by fragmentation  C2656  1   31 
           of a 140-MeV/u 82Se stable beam impinging on a         C2656  1   32 
           329 mg/cm2 9Be production target and was separated     C2656  1   33 
           with a 300 mg/cm2 Al degrader in the A1900 fragment    C2656  1   34 
           separator.The secondary beam contained 46% of 68Co,    C2656  1   35 
           40% of 66Fe and 9.5% of 65Mn.                          C2656  1   36
