SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen target located at the target position  C2410  1   17 
           of the S800. The liquid hydrogen was contained by a    C2410  1   18 
           cylindrical aluminum target cell, with a 125 mu-m      C2410  1   19 
           Kapton entrance and exit windows. The nominal target   C2410  1   20 
           thickness was 30 mm. The temperature and the pressure  C2410  1   21 
           of the target cell were 17.0 K and 880 Torr.           C2410  1   22 
           Variations of target thickness caused by pressure      C2410  1   23 
           difference across Kapton entrance and exit windows     C2410  1   24 
           were taken into account. Areal density of the target   C2410  1   25 
           was (240+-2) mg/cm2.                                   C2410  1   26 
DETECTOR   (IOCH) Outgoing beam particles were identified by      C2410  1   27

           (HPGE) The gamma rays emitted by the reaction products C2410  1   30 
           were detected by eight modules of the GRETINA          C2410  1   31 
           gamma-ray tracking array, centered on the target.      C2410  1   32 
           Eight modules housing four 36-fold segmented           C2410  1   33 
           high-purity germanium crystals were installed on one   C2410  1   34 
           of the GRETINA mounting hemispheres to accommodate     C2410  1   35 
           the target. Two modules were centered at 58deg, four   C2410  1   36 
           at 90deg, and two at 122deg with respect to the beam   C2410  1   37 
           axis.                                                  C2410  1   38 
METHOD     (TOF) Particles in the secondary beam as well as       C2410  1   39 
           reaction products were identified using time of flight.C2410  1   40 
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The secondary beams 42,44S and 41,43P were     C2410  1   41 
           produced by fragmentation of a 140 MeV/nucleon 48Ca    C2410  1   42 
           primary beam in a 1222 mg/cm2 9Be production target    C2410  1   43 
           and separated by the A1900 fragment separator. Two     C2410  1   44 
           magnet settings of the A1900 were used with momentum   C2410  1   45 
           acceptance of 2%. Aluminium wedge was used to          C2410  1   46 
           separate secondary beams by Z. The secondary beams     C2410  1   47 
           were momentum analysed by S800 spectrograph.           C2410  1   48 
           Particles were identified by time of flight using      C2410  1   49 
           scintillation detectors in A1900 focal plane and       C2410  1   50
