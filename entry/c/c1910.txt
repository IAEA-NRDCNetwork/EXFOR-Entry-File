DETECTOR   (HPGE) Photons emitted from excited states populated   C191000100016 
           in the reaction were detected in the segmented         C191000100017 
           germanium array (SeGA). Fifteen, 32-fold segmented     C191000100018 
           high-purity Ge detectors were arranged in a closely    C191000100019

           axes parallel to the beam axis and at a distance of    C191000100021 
           13.2 cm, covering laboratory polar angles between      C191000100022 
           40deg and 140deg.                                      C191000100023

           (DRFTC,SCIN) Angles and positions in the dispersive    C191000100028 
           and nondispersive planes were measured using two       C191000100029 
           Cathode Readout Drift Counters. Thin plastic           C191000100030 
           scintillators was used for time of flight measurement  C191000100031 
           and a 5-mm thick plastic scintillator placed in the    C191000100032 
           focal plane was used for energy loss measurement.      C191000100033

INC-SOURCE (KINDT) A 120 MeV/u beam of 18-O was impinged upon a   C191000100035 
           1904 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target. An 80 MeV/u 12B secondaryC191000100036 
           beam (with purity exceeding 99%) was separated from    C191000100037 
           other fragmentation products using a 405 mg=cm2 thick  C191000100038 
           aluminum wedge placed at the intermediate image of the C191000100039 
           A1900 fragment separator. The momentum acceptance of   C191000100040 
           the separator was 0.25%, resulting in a secondary 12B  C191000100041
