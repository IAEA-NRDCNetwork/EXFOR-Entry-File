FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The experiments were carried out       C168400100009 
           at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)    C168400100010 
           88-Inch Cyclotron. The LBNL Advanced Electron          C168400100011 
           Cyclotron Resonance source was used to produce a       C168400100012 
           highly ionized (13+) 56Fe ion beam, which was          C168400100013 
           accelerated by the cyclotron to an energy of 280 MeV.  C168400100014 
SAMPLE     250 mu-g/cm2 thick metallic 208Pb (208Pb-98.4%,        C168400100015 
           207Pb-1.1%, and 206Pb-0.5%) targets, which were        C168400100016 
           evaporated on 40 mu-g/cm2 carbon backings              C168400100017 
           and covered by a 5 mu-g/cm2 carbon layer.              C168400100018 
           Incident energy of 276.4 MeV is the ion energy at the  C168400100019 
           middle of the target.                                  C168400100020 
DETECTOR   (SPEC,MWPC,SISD) Recoiling evaporation residues        C168400100021 
           were separated in BGS. Upstream of the focal plane     C168400100022 
           a multiwire proportional chamber allowed separation    C168400100023 
           implantation events from radioactive decay events in   C168400100024 
           focal plane Si strip detectors.                        C168400100025

METHOD     Evaporation residues were implanted in the Si strip    C168400100027 
           detector, located in the focal plane of the            C168400100028 
           spectrometer. 263Hs evaporation residues were          C168400100029 
           identified by series of alpha decays in Si strip       C168400100030 
           detector, located close to the impact of               C168400100031 
           evaporation residuum.                                  C168400100032
