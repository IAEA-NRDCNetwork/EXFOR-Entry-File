FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Irradiations at the energy of 800 MeV  C197700100015 
           were performed in the 'Blue Room' at the Los Alamos    C197700100016 
           National Laboratory's Neutron Science Center           C197700100017 
           (SYNCH,2ZZZCER)Irradiations at the energy of 1.4 GeV   C197700100018 
           were conducted at CERN ISOLDE facility using the       C197700100019 
           RABBIT system. Exposures were also carried out in air  C197700100020 
           with the 23 GeV beam at the IRRADIATION 1 Facility at  C197700100021 
           the CERN PS East Hall.                                 C197700100022 
SAMPLE     At 800 Mev the Te target was fabricated from 99.9999%  C197700100023 
           pure Te Alpha Aesar metallic powder that was pressed   C197700100024 
           into a 6.9-mm thick disk that had 93.4% of normal Te   C197700100025 
           metal density.A stack consisted of 6.4 mm thick        C197700100026 
           polyethylene in front of the Te target and then an     C197700100027 
           aluminum backing of 2 mm thickness. Polyethylene and   C197700100028 
           Al foils served for beam monitoring purposes.          C197700100029 
           A telluride crystals TeO2 with mass of 0.457 g and     C197700100030 
           irregular shape was irradiated at the 1.4 GeV beam of  C197700100031 
           ISOLDE. At the energy of 23 GeV two samples were       C197700100032 
           used. A crystal of TeO2 of irregular shape with a      C197700100033 
           mass of 0.428 g and a larger TeO2 crystal of 23x22 mm  C197700100034 
           sides and 1.6 mm thickness.                            C197700100035 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Several HPGe detectors were used to measure     C197700100036 
           induced activity of irradiated samples with            C197700100037

           used at LBNL's Low Background Facility. Samples        C197700100041 
           irradiated at CERN were measured using 40% efficiency  C197700100042

METHOD     (ACTIV)Samples were irradiated for several minutes.    C197700100047

           times between irradiation and activity measurements    C197700100049 
           varied from 1200 sec to 10 hours and counting times    C197700100050 
           from 1000 sec to 10 days. Long lived products were     C197700100051 
           measured for period up to several days after delay     C197700100052 
           varying from 16  days to several years for a period    C197700100053
