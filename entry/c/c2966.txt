DETECTOR   (HPGE,BGO) The detector system consisted of a single,  C296600100016

           bismuth germanate (BGO) shield for active Compton      C296600100019 
           background suppression. The detectors were mounted on  C296600100020 
           a rail system at an angle of 45 degree relative to     C296600100021 
           the beam, which allowed the detector to be easily      C296600100022 
           moved to different distances from the target in order  C296600100023

           calibration as well as increase the efficiency         C296600100025 
           throughout the resonance scans. In the following,      C296600100026

           distances between target and end cap of the HPGe       C296600100028 
           detector of 1 and 20 cm, respectively.                 C296600100029 
SAMPLE     For the present experiment, a new potassium target     C296600100030 
           composition of K2WO4 was used with 99.5% purity and    C296600100031 
           natural K abundance (93.258% 39K, 0.012% 40K, and      C296600100032 
           6.730% 41K). The target material was evaporated onto   C296600100033 
           tantalum backings of 0.3 mm thickness. Targets with    C296600100034 
           two different thicknesses were used in the present     C296600100035 
           experiment: (i) 100 microg/cm2 with an approximate     C296600100036 
           energy loss of 25 keV at Ep = 600 keV to map out the   C296600100037 
           resonances after they had been identified, either      C296600100038 
           from previous direct measurements or from the present  C296600100039 
           thick-target measurements, and (ii) 500 microg/cm2     C296600100040 
           thick targets to investigate and explore resonances    C296600100041 
           below Ep = 600 keV.                                    C296600100042 
METHOD     The experiment was divided into three phases. First,   C296600100043 
           the resonances above 600 keV were mapped out with a    C296600100044 
           thin target. Second, long measurements on top of the   C296600100045 
           respective thick target yield plateaus were performed  C296600100046 
           in order to obtain precise measurements of the         C296600100047 
           resonance strengths. Finally, thicker targets were     C296600100048 
           used to search for new resonances in the region below  C296600100049 
           600 keV using long irradiation times.                  C296600100050 
ANALYSIS   (SLA) The strengths of the observed resonances can be  C296600100051 
           directly obtained from the on-resonance gamma-ray      C296600100052 
           yield measured on top of the resonance yield curve     C296600100053 
           Ymax. The resonance strength (omega gamma) results     C296600100054 
           from the of the Breit-Wigner cross section over the    C296600100055 
           target thickness or energy loss of the incident        C296600100056 
           protons and is expressed by omega gamma=               C296600100057 
            (2 Ymax e eff)/(lambdar**2 bgamma nu gamma) where     C296600100058 
           where e eff is the stopping power of the protons in theC296600100059 
            target material, lambdar the de Broglie wavelength of C296600100060 
           the proton at the resonance energy, bgamma the         C296600100061 
           branching ratio of the gamma-decay.                    C296600100062
