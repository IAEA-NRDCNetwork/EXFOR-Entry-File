SAMPLE     (82-PB-207,ENR=0.924) Targets of enriched 207Pb (92.4  C2475  1   10 
           percent) in their foil form.                           C2475  1   11 
METHOD     (CHSEP) Targets were bombarded by the 65 MeV helium    C2475  1   12 
           ions in Berkeley, California. The targets were then    C2475  1   13 
           flown to the laboratories in Bellingham where the      C2475  1   14 
           fission fragments were separated by standard           C2475  1   15 
           radiochemical techniques. The period of time between   C2475  1   16 
           the end of bombardment to the time when counting of    C2475  1   17 
           the radiochemically separated species began, was       C2475  1   18

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) It was assumed that the beam currents of    C2475  2    4 
           the Berkeley cyclotron were steady within a 10 per     C2475  2    5 
           cent deviation and since the counting statistics were  C2475  2    6 
           extremely good for the species separated (~5 percent   C2475  2    7 
           error) , the values quoted in this table have an error C2475  2    8
