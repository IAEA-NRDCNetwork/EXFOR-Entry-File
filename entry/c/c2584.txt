FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment was carried out using       C2584  1   17 
           coupled cyclotrons at the NSCL East Lansing. This      C2584  1   18 
           facility served to produce 22Mg ions.                  C2584  1   19 
           (LINAC,1USAMSU) 22Mg ions were injected into the ReA3  C2584  1   20 
           reaccelerator and accelerated to 5 MeV/u               C2584  1   21 
SAMPLE     Sample was an Active-Target time projection chamber    C2584  1   22 
            (TPC) filled with mixture of 95% He and 5% CO2 at     C2584  1   23 
           the pressure of 600 torr. The active volume of the     C2584  1   24 
           TPC is cylinder of length 1 m and of a radius 29.2 cm. C2584  1   25 
DETECTOR   The time projection chamber was at the same time He    C2584  1   26 
           target as well as the detector of reaction products.   C2584  1   27 
           Cylindrical TPC is placed in uniform magnetic field    C2584  1   28 
           of 1.9T produced by solenoidal magnet. The sensor      C2584  1   29 
           plane consisted of approx. 10000 equilateral triangle  C2584  1   30 
           pads which provided x-y information of the particle    C2584  1   31 
           track. Drift time of the electrons provided            C2584  1   32 
           longitudinal z component of the track.                 C2584  1   33 
           (IOCH) A thin ionization chamber placed in front of th C2584  1   34 
           TPC, filled with isobutane at 10 torr was used to      C2584  1   35 
           record the beam intensity aand identified the beam     C2584  1   36 
           contaminants. Signal from ionization chamber was used  C2584  1   37 
           also for time reference of the TPC signals.            C2584  1   38 
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used.                           C2584  1   39 
INC-SOURCE 22Mg was produced from the fragmentation of a 24Mg     C2584  1   40 
           primary beam accelerated by the coupled cyclotrons     C2584  1   41 
           and selected by the A1900 fragment separator. The      C2584  1   42 
           22Mg fragments were stopped in gas cell and            C2584  1   43 
           transported to electron beam ion source. The ions      C2584  1   44 
           from ion source were injected to ReA3 reaccelerator    C2584  1   45 
           and accelerated to cca 5 MeV/A with average beam       C2584  1   46 
           intensity of 900 pps.                                  C2584  1   47
