SAMPLE     Targets were produced by evaporating WO3 of natural    C1103  2    4 
           isotopic constitution onto arrays of 0.5 mm thick      C1103  2    5 
           tantalum blanks The mass density deposited was         C1103  2    6 
           measured to be 4.0 mg/cm2 by a crystal-oscillator      C1103  2    7 
           thickness monitor system.                              C1103  2    8 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 7.6 x 7.6 cm NaI(Tl) crystals.                 C1103  2    9 
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The targets were irradiated with the     C1103  2   10 
           proton beam for periods comparable to the 13N          C1103  2   11 
           half-life. After bombardment, the targets were         C1103  2   12 
           transformed to an off-line annihilation spectrometer   C1103  2   13 
           which counted coincidence pulses between two NaI(Tl)   C1103  2   14 
           crystals.                                              C1103  2   15 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The cross-section scale is estimated to be  C1103  2   16 
           uncertain by 15% owing to the uncertainty in           C1103  2   17 
           determination of the absolute oxygen content of the    C1103  2   18 
           targets and to the uncertainty in the value of the     C1103  2   19 
           spectrometer efficiency.                               C1103  2   20 
COMMENT    Authors say that in their opinion the cs to higher     C1103  2   21
