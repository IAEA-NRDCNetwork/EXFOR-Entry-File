           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using       C196600100012 
           A1200 fragment separator.                              C196600100013 
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes  C196600100014 
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and      C196600100015 
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists    C196600100016 
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric    C196600100017 
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)       C196600100018 
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three        C196600100019 
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,       C196600100020 
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,            C196600100021 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C196600100022 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C196600100023 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C196600100024 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C196600100025 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C196600100026 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C196600100027 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C196600100028 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C196600100029 
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a      C196600100030 
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.      C196600100031 
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin      C196600100032 
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator      C196600100033 
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed   C196600100034 
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI              C196600100035 
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by      C196600100036 
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling  C196600100037 
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage      C196600100038 
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.    C196600100039
