SAMPLE     Nitrogen targets were prepared by implanting 14N ions  C2238  1   13 
           into (0.35+-0.05)-mm-thick tantalum backings of 99.95% C2238  1   14 
           metals-basis purity. The target stoichiometry was      C2238  1   15 
           determined via Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. C2238  1   16 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Coaxial HPGe detector with a diameter of (89.0  C2238  1   17 
           +-0.5) mm and a length of (91.6+-1.0) mm, resulting in C2238  1   18 
           135% relative efficiency. The HPGe and target chamber  C2238  1   19 
           were surrounded by an annulus of NaI(Tl)               C2238  1   20 
           scintillators, which were not used in present          C2238  1   21 
           measurements.                                          C2238  1   22 
           (NAICR) Segmented annular detector consisting of 24    C2238  1   23 
           position sensitive trapezoidal crystals with           C2238  1   24 
           dimensions 55.0 x 6.0 x 5.5/7.0 cm3 (L x H x W).       C2238  1   25 
           Each NaI(Tl) bar has a photomultiplier tube (PMT)      C2238  1   26 
           coupled to either end. Position and energy of each     C2238  1   27 
           detected photon could be reconstructed.                C2238  1   28
