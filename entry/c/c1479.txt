DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A silicon surface barrier detector (alpha      C1479  1   13 
            counting detector) with an active area of 450 mm2     C1479  1   14 
            and a nominal thickness of 40 microm was used to      C1479  1   15 
            count the alpha particles from the reaction.          C1479  1   16 
SAMPLE     The 7Be (from TRIUMF) was separated from lithium with  C1479  1   17 
            a glass filter in a pH 8 - 9 solution, and left in    C1479  1   18 
            Be0 form. Then the 7Be underwent reductive vacuum     C1479  1   19 
            evaporation onto a catcher crucible. The target       C1479  1   20 
            backing was made from molybdenum consisting of a flat C1479  1   21 
            plate with a 4 mm-diameter, 1.4 mm-height post in the C1479  1   22 
            center.                                               C1479  1   23 
MONITOR    A calibration detector was 47.42 mm away from the      C1479  1   24 
            target, and a 0.700 inches-diameter collimator was    C1479  1   25 
            placed in front of the calibration detector to        C1479  1   26 
            determine precisely the geometrical solid angle of    C1479  1   27 
            the CY counting detector. The solid angle ratio of    C1479  1   28 
            the counting and calibration detectors was determined C1479  1   29 
            with the 7Li(d,p)8Li resonance at Ed = 770 keV.       C1479  1   30
