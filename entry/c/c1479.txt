DETECTOR   (SIBAR) A silicon surface barrier detector (alpha      C147900100013 
            counting detector) with an active area of 450 mm2     C147900100014 
            and a nominal thickness of 40 microm was used to      C147900100015 
            count the alpha particles from the reaction.          C147900100016 
SAMPLE     The 7Be (from TRIUMF) was separated from lithium with  C147900100017 
            a glass filter in a pH 8 - 9 solution, and left in    C147900100018 
            Be0 form. Then the 7Be underwent reductive vacuum     C147900100019 
            evaporation onto a catcher crucible. The target       C147900100020 
            backing was made from molybdenum consisting of a flat C147900100021 
            plate with a 4 mm-diameter, 1.4 mm-height post in the C147900100022 
            center.                                               C147900100023 
MONITOR    A calibration detector was 47.42 mm away from the      C147900100024 
            target, and a 0.700 inches-diameter collimator was    C147900100025 
            placed in front of the calibration detector to        C147900100026 
            determine precisely the geometrical solid angle of    C147900100027 
            the CY counting detector. The solid angle ratio of    C147900100028 
            the counting and calibration detectors was determined C147900100029 
            with the 7Li(d,p)8Li resonance at Ed = 770 keV.       C147900100030
