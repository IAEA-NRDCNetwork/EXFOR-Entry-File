INC-SPECT  The energies of the deuterons inducing fission varied  C2199  1   11 
           from 8.5 to 9.9 MeV, one-half of the fissions being    C2199  1   12 
           produced by deuterons with energies above 9.5 MeV.     C2199  1   13 
           Less than 0.5 per cent of the fissions were induced    C2199  1   14 
           by neutrons.                                           C2199  1   15

           irradiated with a deuteron beam of the Washington      C2199  1   22 
           University Cyclotron. Relative yields were determined  C2199  1   23 
           by comparison of fission-product radioactivities from  C2199  1   24 
           232Th fission induced by 9.5 MeV deuterons with those  C2199  1   25 
           from 235U thermal neutron fission, for which fission   C2199  1   26 
           yields are known. Irradiated targets were dissolved    C2199  1   27 
           in hydrochloric acid, and aliquots of the solutions    C2199  1   28 
           were taken for radiochemical analysis.                 C2199  1   29

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Many sources of uncertainties are           C2199  2    8 
           inherited in this treatment: probably the largest is   C2199  2    9 
           contributes by the assumption of a smooth,             C2199  2   10 
           symmetrical yield-mass curve. Another possible source  C2199  2   11 
           of uncertainty is the assumption that the generic      C2199  2   12 
           history of fission product is the same for two         C2199  2   13

ANALYSIS   Obtained yield-mass curve is symmetrical about A=115,  C2199  3    4 
           which implies an average loss of 4 neutrons during or  C2199  3    5

           mass unit give curves with appreciable deviations      C2199  3    7 
           from the experimental data. We conclude, therefore,    C2199  3    8 
           that neutron multiplicity is 4+-1.                     C2199  3    9
