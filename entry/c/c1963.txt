SAMPLE     Natural Al sample with dimensions of 11.5 x 11.5 cm2   C196300100013 
           and thickness of 3 mm                                  C196300100014 
DETECTOR   (TRD) Stack of CR39 polymer track detectors with       C196300100015 
           dimensions  of 11.5 x 11.5 cm2. In the stack there     C196300100016 
           were two CR39 detectors upstream and 10 CR39 detectors C196300100017 
           downstream of the 3mm Al target. Detectors were coveredC196300100018

ANALYSIS   Nuclear track detectors were etched after the          C196300100022 
           irradiation. Charge of the passing ions was determined C196300100023 
           from track diameter. Cross section was determined      C196300100024 
           from comparison of number of tracks in detectors       C196300100025 
           placed in front of the Al target with number of tracks C196300100026 
           in detectors placed behind the Al target.              C196300100027
