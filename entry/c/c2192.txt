FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USANAL) Proton irradiation at 120 GeV was      C2192  1   17 
           performed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory C2192  1   18 
           (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) Proton irradiation at 392 MeV was      C2192  1   19 
           performed at Ring Cyclotron of Research Center for     C2192  1   20 
           Nuclear Physics, Osaka University,                     C2192  1   21 
METHOD     (CHSEP,AMS) After irradiation, the target samples      C2192  1   22 
           were prepared chemically for the AMS measurements.     C2192  1   23 
           Samples were dissolved in HNO3 after adding 200 mu-g   C2192  1   24 
           of Be and 500 mu-g of Al carriers. The Y was firstly   C2192  1   25 
           precipitated from its solutions as Y2(C2O4)3 by        C2192  1   26 
           adding oxalic acid. The Be and Al were separated by    C2192  1   27 
           cation exchange (Dowex 50WX8,100 - 200 mesh) using 1 M C2192  1   28 
           HCl and 1.5 M HCl, respectively. The isotopic ratios   C2192  1   29 
           of 10Be/9Be and 26Al/27Al in the Y and Tb target       C2192  1   30 
           foils were determined by AMS at MALT (Micro Analysis   C2192  1   31 
           Laboratory, Tandem accelerator), University of Tokyo   C2192  1   32 
           From the Cu sample, the target element was removed by  C2192  1   33 
           anion exchange.Isotopic ratio of 10Be/9Be and 26Al/27AlC2192  1   34 
           was determined by atomic mass spectroscopy.            C2192  1   35 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)The uncertainties (+-1sigma) quoted in the      C2192  1   36 
           production cross sections were obtained by adding      C2192  1   37
