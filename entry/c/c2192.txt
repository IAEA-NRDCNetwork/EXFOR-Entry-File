FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USANAL) Proton irradiation at 120 GeV was      C219200100018 
           performed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory C219200100019 
           (CYCLO,2JPNOSA) Proton irradiation at 392 MeV was      C219200100020 
           performed at Ring Cyclotron of Research Center for     C219200100021 
           Nuclear Physics, Osaka University,                     C219200100022 
METHOD     (CHSEP,AMS) After irradiation, the target samples      C219200100023 
           were prepared chemically for the AMS measurements.     C219200100024 
           Samples were dissolved in HNO3 after adding 200 mu-g   C219200100025 
           of Be and 500 mu-g of Al carriers. The Y was firstly   C219200100026 
           precipitated from its solutions as Y2(C2O4)3 by        C219200100027 
           adding oxalic acid. The Be and Al were separated by    C219200100028 
           cation exchange (Dowex 50WX8,100 - 200 mesh) using 1 M C219200100029 
           HCl and 1.5 M HCl, respectively. The isotopic ratios   C219200100030 
           of 10Be/9Be and 26Al/27Al in the Y and Tb target       C219200100031 
           foils were determined by AMS at MALT (Micro Analysis   C219200100032 
           Laboratory, Tandem accelerator), University of Tokyo   C219200100033 
           From the Cu sample, the target element was removed by  C219200100034 
           anion exchange.Isotopic ratio of 10Be/9Be and 26Al/27AlC219200100035 
           was determined by atomic mass spectroscopy.            C219200100036 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T)The uncertainties (+-1sigma) quoted in the      C219200100037 
           production cross sections were obtained by adding      C219200100038
