FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment was performed at the         C2239  1   13

SAMPLE     (6-C-13,ENR=0.99) Self-supporting 13C target of 45 mu- C2239  1   15 
           g/cm2 nominal thickness.                               C2239  1   16 
DETECTOR   (SISD) An array of four double sided silicon strip     C2239  1   17 
           detectors was employed in order to detect the four     C2239  1   18 
           alpha particles. Each DSSDwas 500 mu-m thick and 5 x 5 C2239  1   19 
           cm2 in active area. Each face was segmented into 16    C2239  1   20 
           strips of 3 mm width, with the front face strips being C2239  1   21 
           horizontal and those on the rear face vertical. The    C2239  1   22 
           detector distances and center angles were 10.0 cm and  C2239  1   23 
           +50.8deg, 14.0 cm and +23.5deg, 13.9 cm and -28.6deg,  C2239  1   24 
           and 10.7 cm and -54.5deg.                              C2239  1   25 
METHOD     (COINC) Events in which four charged particles were    C2239  1   26 
           detected in the DSSD array were selected. Energy and   C2239  1   27 
           position calibrations were applied to the data.        C2239  1   28 
INC-SPECT  Authors used events with three incident alpha beam     C2239  1   29 
           energies (27.0, 27.5, 28.0 MeV).                       C2239  1   30 
ANALYSIS   As no particle identification was provided directly by C2239  1   31 
           the detectors, the four hits were assumed to be alpha  C2239  1   32 
           particles in the analysis. The undetected neutron      C2239  1   33 
           energy was determined for each event from the missing  C2239  1   34 
           momentum between the beam and four detected alpha      C2239  1   35 
           particles,                                             C2239  1   36
