INC-SOURCE (POLIS) The 312-MeV polarized proton beam.             C2643  1   10 
SAMPLE     A liquid hydrogen target.                              C2643  1   11 
DETECTOR   Three counters. Counter No 3 is a symmetrical ring,    C2643  1   12 
           divided into two parts along a vertical diameter       C2643  1   13 
           parallel to polarization of the incident beam.         C2643  1   14

           halves of counter No. 3 were counted independently,    C2643  1   16

ANALYSIS   The cross section was obtained by adding the           C2643  2    6 
           fractions of the beam scattered by hydrogen into the   C2643  2    7 
           two halves of counter No 3 and multiplying this by the C2643  2    8 
           appropriate geometrical factors for each angle. Since  C2643  2    9 
           the relative accuracy is better than the absolute,     C2643  2   10 
           the values have been adjusted to give 3.7x10**-27 cm2  C2643  2   11 
           per steradian at 20 degrees (center of mass).          C2643  2   12

ANALYSIS   The asymmetry was obtained from the formula, e = [(fl- C2643  3    4 
           fr)/(fl+fr)]*(phi*sin phi), where fl, fr are the       C2643  3    5 
           fractions of beam protons scattered into the left and  C2643  3    6 
           right sides of counter No 3, respectively, and 2*phi isC2643  3    7 
           the azimuthal angle covered by either half of          C2643  3    8 
           counter. Since the beam polarization has been          C2643  3    9 
           previously measured in elastic scattering experiments, C2643  3   10 
           we may calculate directly the polarizations arising    C2643  3   11 
           from the p-p scattering in this experiment through     C2643  3   12 
           the relation P=e/Pb, where Pb has been taken to be     C2643  3   13 
           0.74+-0.01.                                            C2643  3   14
