SAMPLE     (92-U-238,ENR=0.999) Circular pieces of uranium foil,  C2432  1    9 
           supplied by Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., Erwin,        C2432  1   10 
           Tennessee, of 2-mil (96.8mg/cm2) thickness served as   C2432  1   11 
           the target material. Isotopic analysis supplied by     C2432  1   12 
           the manufacturer was given as 99.9% 238U. The target   C2432  1   13 
           assembly consisted of three pieces of uranium          C2432  1   14 
           "sandwiched" between l-mil aluminum catcher foils,     C2432  1   15 
           i.e. a l-mil aluminum foil followed by a 2-mil         C2432  1   16 
           uranium foil, two 1-mil aluminum foils, a uranium      C2432  1   17 
           foil, etc.                                             C2432  1   18 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC,PROPC,NAICR) A calibrated GM counter or a       C2432  1   19 
           windowless proportional counter of known geometry      C2432  1   20 
            (Canberra Instruments). In some cases these           C2432  1   21 
           measurements were supplemented by gamma-counting with  C2432  1   22 
           a NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal in conjunction with a  C2432  1   23 
           Nuclear Data 512 pulse-height channel analyzer.        C2432  1   24 
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) Following irradiation the target         C2432  1   25 
           assembly was dismantled and each uranium target        C2432  1   26 
           dissolved in HCl and HNO3 together with its forward    C2432  1   27 
           and backward recoil catcher foils. Final forms of the  C2432  1   28 
           counting samples were solids mounted on small pieces   C2432  1   29 
           of filter paper and aluminum discs and covered with    C2432  1   30 
           Pliofilm. The final precipitates were generally        C2432  1   31 
           counted with multiple detectors.                       C2432  1   32 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Decay curves were resolved into their          C2432  1   33 
           components and a disintegration rate computed. The     C2432  1   34 
           rate was then converted into an absolute cross         C2432  1   35 
           section.                                               C2432  1   36

INC-SPECT  Cyclotron irradiations, employing a total 3He current  C2432  5    4 
           of 2.5 microamph, were carried out at Argonne          C2432  5    5 
           National Laboratory. The energy of the 3He ion beam    C2432  5    6 
           incident upon the face of the third target was         C2432  5    7 
           calculated as 13.8 MeV which is completely degraded.   C2432  5    8
