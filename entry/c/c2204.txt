FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the    C220400100015 
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at       C220400100016 
           Michigan State University using Coupled Cyclotron      C220400100017 
           Facility                                               C220400100018 
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 51 mg/cm2                 C220400100019 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The 12Be reaction products were deflected by   C220400100020 
           a large-gap sweeper magnet and identified from         C220400100021 
           energy-loss and time-of-flight measurements.           C220400100022 
           (SCIN) Neutrons were detected using MoNA array. The    C220400100023 
           MoNA consists of 144 individual detector modules. Each C220400100024 
           module is based on a 200 x 10 x 10 cm3 block of BC-408 C220400100025 
           plastic scintillator. In the nominal configuration the C220400100026 
           vertical layers of 16 of the scintillator blocks give  C220400100027 
           a detector volume of 2.0 x 1.6 x 0.9 m3. Neutron energyC220400100028 
           and position was determined from time of flight.       C220400100029 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between charged particle reaction  C220400100030 
           products and neutrons were required.                   C220400100031 
           (TOF) Momentum and energy of neutrons were determined  C220400100032 
           from time of flight measurement                        C220400100033 
INC-SOURCE Primary beam 18-O with energy of 120MeV/A bombarded a  C220400100034 
           2.5 g/cm2 9Be production target. The A1900 fragment    C220400100035 
           separator was used to separate and select the 13B      C220400100036 
           secondary beam. The final energy of the beam was 71    C220400100037 
           MeV/A, with an intensity of approximately 8.0E+5       C220400100038 
           particles per second and a purity of 96%. 13Be was     C220400100039 
           produced in a nucleon exchange reaction and immediatelyC220400100040 
           decayed into 12Be + n.                                 C220400100041
