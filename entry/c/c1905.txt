FACILITY   (CCW,1CANTMF) Measurements were performed in inverse   C190500100011 
           kinematics at the DRAGON recoil separator, located at  C190500100012 
           the ISAC facility at TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada.        C190500100013 
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with hydrogen maintained  C190500100014 
           at a pressure within 3% of 7 Torr (measurement         C190500100015 
           uncertainty of 2%), with an effective target length    C190500100016 
           of 12.3 +- 0.5 cm                                      C190500100017 
DETECTOR   (BGO) Windowless target was surrounded by an array of  C190500100018 
           30 BGO (bismuth germanate) gamma detectors in a tight  C190500100019 
           geometry. The resolution of the BGO array was about    C190500100020 
           20% at 660 keV for the whole array.                    C190500100021
