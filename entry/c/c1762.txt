SAMPLE     A thick target of RbCl with sufficient aluminum.       C1762  1    9 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) For irradiations short with respect to   C1762  1   10 
           the half-lives the relative yields of radioactive      C1762  1   11 
           products are inversely proportional to their           C1762  1   12 
           half-lives. Thus, after a 1-hr irradiation, the ratio  C1762  1   13 
           of the Y88/Y87 activities is about 0.03 of the ratio   C1762  1   14 
           of the saturation activities. The Y88 activity formed  C1762  1   15 
           is consequently very small and may be ignored, Y90 is  C1762  1   16 
           also formed in relatively small quantities. The        C1762  1   17 
           Y86/Y87 factor, however, is about 5.0, and the         C1762  1   18 
           presence of Y s6 is a problem. The formation of the    C1762  1   19 
           bulk of the Y86 may be eliminated by using             C1762  1   20 
           alpha-particles of an initial energy of about 35 MeV.  C1762  1   21 
           Degradation of the alpha-particle energy by the        C1762  1   22 
           proper amount is achieved by covering the rubidium     C1762  1   23 
           chloride target with sufficient aluminum. The yttrium, C1762  1   24 
           after purification, is loaded onto a Dowex-1 column    C1762  1   25 
           in the carbonate form. Y85,87 decay to strontium       C1762  1   26 
           isotopes. The Sr87m is milked with a citric acid       C1762  1   27 
           solution(0.005% at pH 5.0).                            C1762  1   28
