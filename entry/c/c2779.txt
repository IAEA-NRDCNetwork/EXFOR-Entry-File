DETECTOR   (NAICR) The detection system consisted of two 7.5 cm   C2779001    8 
           diameter by 7.5 cm thick NaI crystals mounted          C2779001    9 
           face-to-face with the target centered between them.    C2779001   10 
           The decay of 18F was detected by counting 511 keV      C2779001   11 
           annihilation gamma-rays in coincidence. The            C2779001   12 
           separation between the detector faces was 5.7 cm.      C2779001   13 
           Except for the solid angle subtended by the crystals,  C2779001   14 
           the volume between the two faces was filled in with    C2779001   15 
           lead. The efficiency of the system was measured        C2779001   16 
           using a calibrated 22Na source and found to be         C2779001   17 
            (3.13+/-0.15)%.                                       C2779001   18 
SAMPLE     Thick disks, 1.25 cm in diameter and 0.4 cm thick, of  C2779001   19 
           sintered TiN were used as targets. The targets were    C2779001   20 
           air-cooled.                                            C2779001   21

CORRECTION Corrected for the 3% electron-capture branch of the    C2779001   23 
           18F decay, for the detection efficiency, for the 18F   C2779001   24 
           decay during bombardment and during transfer to the    C2779001   25 
           detection assembly and for background.                 C2779001   26
