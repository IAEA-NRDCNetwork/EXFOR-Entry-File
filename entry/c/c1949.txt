SAMPLE     Natural thorium foils of 99.7% purity were used. Two   C194900100014 
           foils were used as targets for this experiment, each   C194900100015 
           measuring 2.5cm x 2.5 cm and having thicknesses of     C194900100016 
           48.1 and 52.8 mg/cm2. Aluminum beam monitoring         C194900100017 
           foil with the same dimensions and a thickness of       C194900100018 
           65.3mg/cm2 was incorporated downstream of the thorium  C194900100019 
           targets. All foils were sandwiched between single      C194900100020 
           layers of Kapton tape with a thickness of 25 mu-m,     C194900100021 
           which served as a catcher foil for recoil ions.        C194900100022 
DETECTOR   (HPGE,GELI) One thorium foil was initially counted on  C194900100023 
           a PGT Ge(Li) detector with a relative efficiency of    C194900100024 
           13.7%. The HPGe detector used for additional           C194900100025 
           measurement had efficiency of 10%                      C194900100026

METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were determined from analysis   C194900100028 
           of gamma ray decay curves, followed over period of     C194900100029 
           several months.                                        C194900100030 
ANALYSIS   The 225Ac, 223,225Ra,and 227Th activities at EOB were  C194900100031
