           thin cylindrical wall, 4cm in diameter, with an        C122300100014 
           entrance and exit window in Mo (2.59 mg/cm2).          C122300100015 
ANALYSIS   The gamma-ray spectra from 15N(p,gamma0)160 were       C122300100016 
           analyzed by fitting them with the standard lineshapes  C122300100017 
           by means of a least-squares computer program. The      C122300100018 
           changes in lineshape and peak efficiency of the        C122300100019 
           detector with energy were taken into account in        C122300100020 
           determining the absolute yields.                       C122300100021

METHOD     The 90 degrees yield was measured from E = 12.7 to     C122300200005 
           18.0 MeV in 100 keV steps (some 50 keV steps) at a     C122300200006 
           gas cell pressure corresponding to a target thickness  C122300200007 
           of the order of 40 keV; from Ep = 10.0 to 11.2 MeV in  C122300200008 
           10 or 20 keV steps math a target thickness of about    C122300200009 
           15 keV; and from Ep = 8.45 to 8. 78 MeV and 13.98 to   C122300200010 
           14.30 MeV in 20 to 25 keV steps with a target          C122300200011 
           thickness also of about 15 keV. The target entrance    C122300200012 
           window introduced a beam energy loss of about 57 keV   C122300200013 
           at Ep = 10 MeV and 37 keV at Ep = 18 MeV, and a beam   C122300200014 
           energy straggle of about 13 keV that is nearly         C122300200015 
           independent of beam energy. The detector solid angle   C122300200016 
           was about 0.15 sr and 13 to 20 cm of paraffin was      C122300200017 
           inserted between the target and the NaI crystal to     C122300200018 
           attenuate fast neutrons which produced an undesirable  C122300200019 
           background in the detector.                            C122300200020
