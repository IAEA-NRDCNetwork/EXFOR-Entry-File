            50 keV.                                               C004400100010

DETECTOR   (COIN,SCIN,SCIN) High pressure gas scintillator at 17  C004400100012

            by 7 cm long coupled to an EMI 6255B photomultiplier. C004400100015 
           This scintillator was in coincidence with two liquid   C004400100016 
            scintillators, p-terphenyl in xylene.                 C004400100017 
CORRECTION Multiple scattering and asymmetry due to the variation C004400100018 
            of neutron intensity over the angle subtended by the  C004400100019 
            scatterer were considered to be negligible.           C004400100020 
           Geometrical corrections were made.                     C004400100021 
           No asymmetries in the apparatus were found within the  C004400100022 
            limits of statistical accuracy.                       C004400100023
