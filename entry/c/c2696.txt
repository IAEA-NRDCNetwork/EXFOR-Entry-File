FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) The experiment was performed using     C2696  1   18 
           IRIS facility in ISAC-II at TRIUMF                     C2696  1   19 
SAMPLE     Thin windowless solid hydrogen (H2) reaction target    C2696  1   20 
           built on a 4.3 mu-m thick Ag foil backing facing       C2696  1   21 
           upstream of the H2 layer. The target cell with the     C2696  1   22 
           foil was cooled to approx. 4 K before forming solid H2.C2696  1   23 
           The average H2 target thickness was 53 mu-m and.       C2696  1   24 
           the target thickness between the first and last runs   C2696  1   25 
           of data-taking period showed a change of 7%.           C2696  1   26 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The radioactive beam of 59Cu was produced via  C2696  1   27 
           spallation of a niobium target with 480 MeV protons.   C2696  1   28 
           The 59Cu beam was re-accelerated using the ISACII      C2696  1   29 
           superconducting LINAC to 8.5A MeV. The average beam    C2696  1   30 
           intensity was approx. 3600 pps. Beam particles were    C2696  1   31 
           identified on event by event basis by measurement      C2696  1   32 
           in ionisation chamber.                                 C2696  1   33 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Charged particles were detected     C2696  1   34 
           using telescope consisting of annular arrays of        C2696  1   35 
           100 mmu-m thick single-sided silicon strip detectors   C2696  1   36 
           followed by a layer of 12 mm thick CsI(Tl) detectors   C2696  1   37 
           placed 15 cm downstream of the target.                 C2696  1   38
