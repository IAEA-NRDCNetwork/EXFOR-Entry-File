FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL) The irradiations were performed with   C2330  1    8 
           the deflected  beams of the Argonne National           C2330  1    9 
           Laboratory 152 cm cyclotron.                           C2330  1   10 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Activation method was used.              C2330  1   11 
           Recoiled product nuclei were collected on a catcher    C2330  1   12 
           foil.The recoil catchers were prepared of very pure    C2330  1   13 
           99.999% aluminium foil having a surface density of     C2330  1   14 
           5 mg/cm2. Following irradiation, polonium was          C2330  1   15 
           chemically separated from the target and catcher foils C2330  1   16
