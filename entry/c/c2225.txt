FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the LBNL 88-   C2225  1   11 
           inch cyclotron facility using the Berkeley gas-filled  C2225  1   12 
           separator.                                             C2225  1   13 
SAMPLE     208Pb target consisted of nine arc shaped segments,    C2225  1   14 
           each with a 500-mg/cm2 thick lead layer sandwiched     C2225  1   15 
           between layers of carbon with thicknesses of 40        C2225  1   16 
           mu-g/cm2 facing the beam and 2 mg/cm2. These segments  C2225  1   17 
           were mounted around the periphery of a 14-inch         C2225  1   18 
           diameter wheel which was rotated to minimize thermal   C2225  1   19 
           stress on the target from beam heating wheel which     C2225  1   20 
           was rotated to minimize thermal stress on the target   C2225  1   21 
           from beam heating.                                     C2225  1   22 
DETECTOR   (SPEC) Berkeley gas-filled separator (BGS) spatially   C2225  1   23 
           separated the recoiling fusion evaporation residues    C2225  1   24 
            (with E approx. 70 MeV) in flight from both beam      C2225  1   25 
           particles and transfer reaction products on the basis  C2225  1   26 
           of their differing magnetic rigidities within the      C2225  1   27 
           separator's 0.88-torr helium atmosphere. The magnetic  C2225  1   28 
           rigidity Br of the recoiling fusion evaporation        C2225  1   29 
           residues (EVR) with Z=110 and A=271 was estimated to   C2225  1   30 
           be 2.1 T m                                             C2225  1   31 
           (SISD) EVR's were deposited at the BGS focal plane     C2225  1   32 
           300-mm thick passivated ion implanted silicon          C2225  1   33 
           detector with an active area of 116 mm (horizontal) x  C2225  1   34 
           358 mm (vertical). Detector recorded the time,         C2225  1   35 
           energy, and position of the implanted EVR's and of     C2225  1   36 
           their subsequent alpha decays. Resistive charge        C2225  1   37 
           division provided vertical position resolution within  C2225  1   38 
           each strip                                             C2225  1   39 
           (PPAC) Parallel plate avalanche counter placed 24 cm   C2225  1   40 
           in front of the strip detector, recorded the time and  C2225  1   41 
           position of recoiling ions before implantation. The    C2225  1   42 
           presence or absence of signals from ions passing       C2225  1   43 
           through the PPAC distinguished beam-related events in  C2225  1   44 
           the strip detector and those from the alpha decay of   C2225  1   45 
           previously implanted ions.                             C2225  1   46 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence of PPAC and SISD within the        C2225  1   47 
           position resolution indicated existence of correlation C2225  1   48 
           between evaporation residues and their alpha decay.    C2225  1   49 
           EVR were identified by alpha decay sequences. Two      C2225  1   50 
           decay chains were observed.                            C2225  1   51
