FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USAROC) Experiment performed at the internal   C199500100008 
           proton beam of the Rochester 130-in. synchrocyclotron  C199500100009 
SAMPLE     Spectroscopically pure cerium dioxide was used as the  C199500100010 
           target material. The target contained approximately    C199500100011 
           100 mg of CeO2                                         C199500100012 
DETECTOR   (PROPC) Samples were counted on an end-window,         C199500100013 
           methane-flow beta proportional counter                 C199500100014 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP)Indirect method which involved determiningC199500100015 
           La141 by counting the daughter Ce141. Within 15 min    C199500100016 
           after termination of the bombardment the CeO2 target   C199500100017 
           material was quantitatively dissolved in 10M HNO3 and  C199500100018 
           made up to a known volume.Two aliquots were taken,     C199500100019 
           one of which was allowed to stand until all the 4-hr   C199500100020 
           La141 had decayed to Ce141. Cerium was immediately     C199500100021 
           separated and precipitated as the oxalate from the     C199500100022 
           other aliquot by the method of Glendenin et al. The    C199500100023 
           aliquot which had been allowed to stand until the      C199500100024 
           La141 had decayed to Ce141 was treated in identical    C199500100025 
           fashion, giving a second oxalate sample for counting   C199500100026 
           which contained Ce141 from the (p,pn) reaction plus    C199500100027 
           that from the decay of the (p,2p) product La141.       C199500100028 
           Chemical yields were determined gravimetrically by     C199500100029 
           ignition of the oxalate to Ce02 after counting was     C199500100030 
           complete.                                              C199500100031
