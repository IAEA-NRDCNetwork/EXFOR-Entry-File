DETECTOR   (SCIN) The detector for the elastically scattered      C197800100010 
           protons was a 12 mm stilbene crystal cube cemented     C197800100011 
           onto the type 5819 photomultiplier with a cement       C197800100012 
           polystyrene dissolved in xylene. A hemispherical dome, C197800100013 
           chromium plated and polished, was placed over the      C197800100014 
           crystal.                                               C197800100015 
METHOD     (PHD) A record on the film was made of the deflection  C197800100016 
           on an oscilloscope due to the pulses caused by 30.6    C197800100017 
           Mev protons elastically scattered at a small angle by  C197800100018 
           a thin gold foil. The data for the scattering from Be, C197800100019 
            C, and Al were taken electronically. Eight scales     C197800100020 
           were set at differing discriminator levels to form a   C197800100021 
           seven channel pulse height analyzer with two volt      C197800100022 
           windows for pulses in the neighborhood of 70 volts.    C197800100023 
           For each observation, a pulse height analysis of this  C197800100024 
           kind was made, and the inelastic events were thus      C197800100025 
           separated from the elastic events.                     C197800100026

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Of the various sources of uncertainty in    C197801000006 
           the above results i. e. the collected charge, the      C197801000007 
           foil surface density, the foil composition, the        C197801000008 
           geometry, the background counting rate, the            C197801000009 
           statistics of counting, and the determination of the   C197801000010 
           proper separation between the elastic and inelastic    C197801000011 
           events; the last two mentioned are by far the most     C197801000012 
           important. From the histograms, an estimate of the     C197801000013 
           uncertainty in the separation of elastic from          C197801000014 
           inelastic events was made. This estimate, combined     C197801000015 
           with the total number of counts in the elastic peak,   C197801000016 
           forms the basis for the uncertainties indicated for a  C197801000017 
           number of points on each of the curves in Figures.     C197801000018 
           The combined estimated uncertainty (probable error)    C197801000019 
           ranges from 8% at small angles to 18% at some of the   C197801000020 
           largest angles of scattering.                          C197801000021

           Plus and Minus angles. For larger angles, phi was set  C197801000025 
           at 45 degrees, and the observations were made on only  C197801000026 
           one side of the beam.                                  C197801000027
