DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivity of a reaction product in the  C3044001   21 
           activated monitor foil or Sr sample was measured       C3044001   22 
           nondestructively using high-purity germanium           C3044001   23

ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The overall uncertainty in the cross section   C3044001   26 
           was obtained by summing in quadrature the individual   C3044001   27 
           uncertainties in: counting statistics (1-10%),         C3044001   28 
           efficiency of the detector (4%), gamma-ray intensities C3044001   29
