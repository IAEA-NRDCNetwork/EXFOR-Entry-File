SAMPLE     The gold targets were prepared by standard             C2466  1   11 
           volatilization methods, using gold of the highest      C2466  1   12 
           available purity. (Available from Cominco Products,    C2466  1   13 
           Inc., Spokane, Washington.) Self-supporting foils of   C2466  1   14 
           thickness ~3 mg/cm2 were obtained, and the thickness   C2466  1   15 
           of the foils was measured by weighing a known area. A  C2466  1   16 
           target thickness of ~3 mg/cm2 is roughly optimum for   C2466  1   17 
           maximum sensitivity for detection of fission fragments.C2466  1   18 
DETECTOR   (TRD) The fission-fragment detectors were rectangular  C2466  1   19 
           strips of mica of width 1 cm, length 1.25 cm, and      C2466  1   20 
           convenient thickness (~10-2 cm) . The strips were      C2466  1   21 
           cleaved along layer planes in order to obtain fresh    C2466  1   22 
           surfaces.                                              C2466  1   23 
METHOD     (EXTB) Upon completion of the bombardments the mica    C2466  1   24 
           detectors were soaked in 27 M hydrofluoric acid for    C2466  1   25 
           30 min and were washed and dried. Finally the strips   C2466  1   26 
           were mounted between two microscope cover glasses.     C2466  1   27 
           The density of fission tracks in a "standard area"     C2466  1   28 
           was determined by scanning under a microscope with a   C2466  1   29 
           suitable magnification.                                C2466  1   30 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The standard error listed as the uncertainty   C2466  1   31 
           in the density of tracks per standard strip is purely  C2466  1   32 
           statistical and does not take into account the         C2466  1   33 
           possibility of systematic errors.                      C2466  1   34
