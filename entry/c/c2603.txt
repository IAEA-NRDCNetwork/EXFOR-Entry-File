SAMPLE     Thorium was separated from uranium ore. The final      C2603  1   11 
           product was 91.32+-0.77 mg of thorium with a purity    C2603  1   12

           determined by mass spectrometry to be 0.0922+-0.00150. C2603  1   14 
           In experiment a target stack  was used to degrade beam C2603  1   15
