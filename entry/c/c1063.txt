SAMPLE     Reactor grade graphite was used as a target.           C1063  1   11 
DETECTOR   (D4PI) 4 pi graphite sphere neutron detector. The      C1063  1   12 
           detector was calibrated for efficiency by comparison   C1063  1   13 
           with a local Pu-Be standard source.                    C1063  1   14

COMMENT    If one reduces the measurements of R.L.Macklin and     C1063  1   17 
           J.H. Gibbons, J,NSE,31,343,1968 by a factor of 10,     C1063  1   18 
           their values above ~5 MeV are only slightly below the  C1063  1   19 
           present results and are within the sum of the stated   C1063  1   20 
           errors. However, in going from 5 to 4.5 MeV, the       C1063  1   21 
           earlier values decrease to ~50% of the present data    C1063  1   22 
           and remain at about this level to the lowest           C1063  1   23 
           alpha-particle energies. We conclude that the earlier  C1063  1   24 
           thick-target yields are in error and should be         C1063  1   25 
           replaced by the present data. (Author)                 C1063  1   26
