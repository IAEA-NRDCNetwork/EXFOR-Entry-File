SAMPLE     Enriched 58Ni foil, with thicknesses of 426 mu-g/cm2,  C197600100015

DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) Protons were detected using dE-E         C197600100019 
           telescopes optimized to detect protons at backward     C197600100020 
           angles. Their dE detectors stopped backscattered low   C197600100021 
           energy alpha particles. Telescopes were placed at      C197600100022 
           backward angles of 117, 132, 147, and 162 deg. Two     C197600100023 
           additional dE-E telescopes were placed at forward      C197600100024 
           angles of +41 deg and -47deg for detection of          C197600100025 
           elastically scattered particles.                       C197600100026

INC-SOURCE (KINDT)Secondary beam produced by elastic scattering   C197600100028 
           of primary He3 beam on Be foil was used in this        C197600100029 
           experiment. Elastically scattered primary beams of     C197600100030 
           16.5, 15.2, and 13.9 MeV, produced secondary beams     C197600100031 
           with laboratory energies at the center of the target   C197600100032 
           of 12.7, 11.5, and 10.2 MeV, respectively. This method C197600100033 
           was used, because it served the additional purpose of  C197600100034 
           determining the contribution of the He3 contaminant    C197600100035 
           beam to the proton yield in companion experiment.      C197600100036
