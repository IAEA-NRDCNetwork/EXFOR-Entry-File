FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Measurements were performed at the     C194500100008 
           end of proton Line B of the Los Alamos Meson Physics   C194500100009 
           Facility (LAMPF).                                      C194500100010 
SAMPLE     High-purity (99.999%) Al foil sandwiched between one   C194500100011 
           front and one back very thin Al monitor foil, each     C194500100012 
           1.50-mg/cm thick, and then wrapped in an envelope of   C194500100013 
           the thinner Al material.The three primary target       C194500100014 
           foils were 7.20, 34.47, and 70.82 mg/cm2 thick, and    C194500100015 
           were irradiated with 800-MeV protons for about 10, 5,  C194500100016 
           and 1 pA h, respectively. This target packet design    C194500100017 
           provided for complete compensation for recoil losses   C194500100018 
           of Mg from the primary target foils of Na from the     C194500100019 
           monitor foils.                                         C194500100020 
DETECTOR   (HPGE,GELI) Induced gamma activities were measured     C194500100021 
           using calibrated Ge(Li) or intrinsic Ge gamma-ray      C194500100022 
           spectrometers.                                         C194500100023 
METHOD     (CHSEP) Each primary Al target foil (having the        C194500100024 
           identical area of the monitor foils) was dissolved     C194500100025 
           with HCl in the presence of Mg carrier, and the        C194500100026 
           solution was radiochemically processed to recover and  C194500100027 
           purify the Mg fraction.                                C194500100028 
           (ACTIV) Only radiations from 21-h Mg and its daughter  C194500100029 
           2.25- min Al were observed in the gamma-ray spectrum,  C194500100030 
           and the yield of Mg was determined from the intensity  C194500100031 
           of the 1779-keV gamma-ray that accompanies every       C194500100032 
           decay of the Al in equilibrium with Mg.                C194500100033
