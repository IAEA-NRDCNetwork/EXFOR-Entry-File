FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) The experiment was carried out at the  C2292  1   13 
           ISAC-I radioactive beam facility at TRIUMF. The ion    C2292  1   14 
           beam was accelerated first by RFQ and then             C2292  1   15 
           postaccelerated using a drift tube linac.              C2292  1   16 
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with H2 at a pressure of  C2292  1   17 
           5 Torr. The beam energy was chosen in order to cover   C2292  1   18 
           a center-of mass energy range Ecm = 447-465 keV        C2292  1   19 
           across the volume of the gas target.                   C2292  1   20 
DETECTOR   (BGO) Array of 30 bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors    C2292  1   21 
           surrounding the windowless gas target was used to      C2292  1   22 
           detect gamma rays resulting from the (p,gamma)         C2292  1   23 
           reaction,                                              C2292  1   24 
           (MAGSP) 20Na6+ recoils were transmitted to the focal   C2292  1   25 
           plane of DRAGON spectrometer and were identified using C2292  1   26 
           time-of-flight system and an isobutane-filled          C2292  1   27 
           ionization chamber                                     C2292  1   28 
           (MCPLT) Time-of-flight (TOF) system was based on two   C2292  1   29 
           microchannel plates detecting secondary electron       C2292  1   30 
           emission from thin diamondlike carbon foils.           C2292  1   31 
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber was used to determine        C2292  1   32 
           energy of recoil ions                                  C2292  1   33 
           (SCIN) Number of incident 19Ne ions was determined by  C2292  1   34 
           measuring 19Ne beta decays in two 6-mm-thick plastic   C2292  1   35 
           scintillators located near an intermediate focus of    C2292  1   36 
           the separator where the 6+ component of the unreacted  C2292  1   37 
           beam was stopped.                                      C2292  1   38 
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,GSPEC,COINC) Inverse kinematics was used      C2292  1   39 
INC-SOURCE (SPALL) An intense radioactive beam (RIB) of 19Ne in   C2292  1   40 
           a 1+ charge state was produced by bombarding a SiC     C2292  1   41 
           target with 500 MeV protons. Products of mass approx.  C2292  1   42 
           19 amu were extracted and ionized in a Forced          C2292  1   43 
           Electron Beam Induced Arc Discharge ion source and     C2292  1   44 
           filtered using a high resolution mass separator. This  C2292  1   45 
           beam was then injected into a radio-frequency          C2292  1   46 
           quadrupole accelerator for an initial acceleration.    C2292  1   47 
           The average 19Ne beam intensity was found to be        C2292  1   48 
           approx. 7E+6 ions per sec.                             C2292  1   49
