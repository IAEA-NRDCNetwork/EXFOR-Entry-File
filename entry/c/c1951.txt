FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed using 800 MeV     C195100100011 
           1H+ ions at the LANSCE accelerator facility in the     C195100100012 
           Weapons Neutron Research (WNR) Blue Room.              C195100100013 
SAMPLE     Natural Terbium foils with diameter of 24.7mm,         C195100100014 
           thickness of 80.4 mg/cm2 and purity of 99.9%. Target   C195100100015 
           foils were sandwiched between single 25 mu-m thick     C195100100016 
           Kapton tape, which served as a catcher for recoil      C195100100017 
           ions.Two target foil stacks were irradiated in the     C195100100018 
           measurement of the data reported here. The first       C195100100019 
           stack included only two terbium foils and accepted a   C195100100020 
           beam current of 49 +- 3 nA for approximately 0.5       C195100100021 
           hours. The second stack, comprised of 10 terbium       C195100100022 
           foils, was irradiated for 10.4 +- 0.1 hours with an    C195100100023 
           average beam current of 50 +- 4 nA                     C195100100024 
DETECTOR   (HPGE)The HPGe detector used to assay the foils was a  C195100100025 
           p-type Al-window ORTEC GEM detector with a relative    C195100100026 
           efficiency at 1333 keV of about 10% and a measured     C195100100027 
           FWHM at 1333 keV of 1.99 keV.                          C195100100028
