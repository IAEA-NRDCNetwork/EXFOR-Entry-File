ANALYSIS   The average initial (i.e. before neutron evaporation)  C2480  3    5 
           total kinetic energy release in the c.m. system is     C2480  3    6 
           found to be 173.3+-5.4 MeV from the gross correlation  C2480  3    7 
           events and 170.9 MeV and 173.5 MeV respectively for    C2480  3    8 
           the 80 and 82 degrees out-of- plane correlation        C2480  3    9

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The absolute errors for the total kinetic   C2480  3   11 
           energy release range from +-4.0 MeV for the most       C2480  3   12 
           probable angles to about +-6.0 MeV for angles on the   C2480  3   13 
           wings of the angular correlation; however, the         C2480  3   14 
           relative error between these points is considerably    C2480  3   15 
           better than this. It is assumed that on the average    C2480  3   16 
           3.5 neutrons per fragment are evaporated from the      C2480  3   17 
           fragments for each fission.                            C2480  3   18
