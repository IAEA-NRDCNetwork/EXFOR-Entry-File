SAMPLE     CH2 target with thickness of a 650 mu-g/cm2.           C186900100013 
DETECTOR   (SISD)The alpha particles were detected                C186900100014 
           in a 1000 mu-m thick annular double-sided Si detector  C186900100015 
            (DSSD) with a back plane segmented into 16 wedges and C186900100016 
           a front  plane divided into 16 rings segmented in      C186900100017 
           theta(lab). The detector was placed such that the 16   C186900100018 
           rings covered an angular range of theta(lab) between   C186900100019 
           8deg and 25deg with respect to the target.             C186900100020 
           (MAGSP,PGAC,IOCH) The 30S reaction products were       C186900100021 
           separated from the main beam (33Cl and 32S), and       C186900100022 
           other reaction products by an Enge split-pole magnetic C186900100023 
           spectrograph. The particles were detected by an xy     C186900100024 
           position-sensitive parallel grid avalanche counter     C186900100025 
           and ionization chamber located at the focal plane of   C186900100026 
           the spectrograph and filled with 5 Torr of isobutane   C186900100027 
           and 15 Torr of CF4 gas, respectively. The PGAC         C186900100028 
           measured the time of flight and the focal-plane        C186900100029 
           position (or magnetic rigidity) of the particles, and  C186900100030 
           the IC gave the energy loss in the gas, allowing       C186900100031 
           rudimentary particle identification.                   C186900100032 
METHOD     (COINC) Alpha particles and 30S reaction products      C186900100033 
           were detected in coincidence to avoid detection of     C186900100034 
           scattered beam.  Inverse kinematics was used with      C186900100035 
           radioactive 33Cl beam                                  C186900100036 
INC-SOURCE 33Cl beam was produced using the in-flight method. A   C186900100037 
           320-MeV primary beam of stable 32S13+ was incident on  C186900100038 
           a gas cell, which was cryogenically cooled to -184     C186900100039 
           deg C and filled with 1.4 atm of D2 gas. The           C186900100040 
           d(32S,33Cl)n reaction produced the desired             C186900100041 
           radioactive 33Cl ions, which were emitted in a cone    C186900100042 
           of 2.5deg. A 20 mu-g/cm2 carbon stripping foil was     C186900100043 
           located immediately following the gas cell to          C186900100044 
           increase the charge state fraction of fully stripped   C186900100045 
           33Cl17+. The ions were then focused with a             C186900100046 
           superconducting solenoid and rebunched with a          C186900100047 
           superconducting resonator. After a 22 deg bending      C186900100048 
           magnet was used, a cocktail beam remained, which       C186900100049 
           consisted mostly of the different charge states of     C186900100050 
           the primary 32S beam and the secondary 33Cl17+ beam.   C186900100051 
           After a radio-frequency (RF) sweeper was used, the     C186900100052 
           32S to 33Cl ratio of approximately 1.4:1. The final    C186900100053 
           beam consisted of the secondary 33Cl17+ ions at 250    C186900100054 
           MeV and the low-energy tails of the primary beam with  C186900100055
