SAMPLE     CH2 target with thickness of a 650 mu-g/cm2.           C1869  1   17 
DETECTOR   (SISD)The alpha particles were detected                C1869  1   18 
           in a 1000 mu-m thick annular double-sided Si detector  C1869  1   19 
            (DSSD) with a back plane segmented into 16 wedges and C1869  1   20 
           a front  plane divided into 16 rings segmented in      C1869  1   21 
           theta(lab). The detector was placed such that the 16   C1869  1   22 
           rings covered an angular range of theta(lab) between   C1869  1   23 
           8deg and 25deg with respect to the target.             C1869  1   24 
           (MAGSP,PGAC,IOCH) The 30S reaction products were       C1869  1   25 
           separated from the main beam (33Cl and 32S), and       C1869  1   26 
           other reaction products by an Enge split-pole magnetic C1869  1   27 
           spectrograph. The particles were detected by an xy     C1869  1   28 
           position-sensitive parallel grid avalanche counter     C1869  1   29 
           and ionization chamber located at the focal plane of   C1869  1   30 
           the spectrograph and filled with 5 Torr of isobutane   C1869  1   31 
           and 15 Torr of CF4 gas, respectively. The PGAC         C1869  1   32 
           measured the time of flight and the focal-plane        C1869  1   33 
           position (or magnetic rigidity) of the particles, and  C1869  1   34 
           the IC gave the energy loss in the gas, allowing       C1869  1   35 
           rudimentary particle identification.                   C1869  1   36 
METHOD     (COINC) Alpha particles and 30S reaction products      C1869  1   37 
           were detected in coincidence to avoid detection of     C1869  1   38 
           scattered beam.  Inverse kinematics was used with      C1869  1   39 
           radioactive 33Cl beam                                  C1869  1   40 
INC-SOURCE 33Cl beam was produced using the in-flight method. A   C1869  1   41 
           320-MeV primary beam of stable 32S13+ was incident on  C1869  1   42 
           a gas cell, which was cryogenically cooled to -184     C1869  1   43 
           deg C and filled with 1.4 atm of D2 gas. The           C1869  1   44 
           d(32S,33Cl)n reaction produced the desired             C1869  1   45 
           radioactive 33Cl ions, which were emitted in a cone    C1869  1   46 
           of 2.5deg. A 20 mu-g/cm2 carbon stripping foil was     C1869  1   47 
           located immediately following the gas cell to          C1869  1   48 
           increase the charge state fraction of fully stripped   C1869  1   49 
           33Cl17+. The ions were then focused with a             C1869  1   50 
           superconducting solenoid and rebunched with a          C1869  1   51 
           superconducting resonator. After a 22 deg bending      C1869  1   52 
           magnet was used, a cocktail beam remained, which       C1869  1   53 
           consisted mostly of the different charge states of     C1869  1   54 
           the primary 32S beam and the secondary 33Cl17+ beam.   C1869  1   55 
           After a radio-frequency (RF) sweeper was used, the     C1869  1   56 
           32S to 33Cl ratio of approximately 1.4:1. The final    C1869  1   57 
           beam consisted of the secondary 33Cl17+ ions at 250    C1869  1   58 
           MeV and the low-energy tails of the primary beam with  C1869  1   59
