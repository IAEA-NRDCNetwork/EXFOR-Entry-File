FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the coupled    C187800100015 
           cyclotron facility of the National Superconducting     C187800100016 
           Cyclotron Laboratory, East Lansing                     C187800100017 
SAMPLE     Liquid hydrogen target placed 65 cm upstream of the    C187800100018 
           pivot point of the S800 spectrograph. The target had   C187800100019 
           an average thickness of 60 mg/cm2 and was contained    C187800100020 
           by 125 mu-m thick Kapton foils.                        C187800100021 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons from the (p,n) reaction were detected  C187800100022 
           in Low-Energy Neutron Detector Array (LENDA),          C187800100023 
           consisting of 24 plastic scintillators bars placed at  C187800100024 
           beam height and at 1 m from the target. Each bar had   C187800100025 
           a vertical height of 300 mm, a depth along the axis    C187800100026 
           through the target of 25 mm, and a width of 45 mm.     C187800100027 
           Laboratory angles between 20deg and 70deg were         C187800100028 
           covered, with gaps of 1.7deg between bars.             C187800100029 
METHOD     (TOF) Neutron energy was determined using time of      C187800100030

INC-SOURCE A 20-pnA, 160 MeV/A beam of 58Ni from the NSCL         C187800100033 
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility struck a 410 mg/cm2 thick   C187800100034 
           Be production target at the entrance of the A1900      C187800100035 
           fragment separator. The secondary beam was             C187800100036 
           purified by placing a 237 mg/cm2 thick aluminum wedge  C187800100037 
           at the intermediate image and a momentum-defining      C187800100038 
           slit at the A1900 focal plane. The resulting cocktail  C187800100039 
           beam of N = 28 isotones, with a momentum spread of     C187800100040 
           0.25%, had an intensity of 8E+5 pps and contained      C187800100041 
           56Ni at 110 MeV/A(66%), 55Co at 106 MeV/A (32%), and   C187800100042 
           54Fe(2%) at 102 MeV/A. The beam energies were obtained C187800100043 
           by injecting the beams into the spectrograph and       C187800100044 
           measuring their momenta. The time of flight (TOF)      C187800100045 
           between an in-beam diamond detector placed upstream    C187800100046 
           of the target and a plastic scintillator placed in     C187800100047 
           the focal plane of the spectrograph uniquely labeled   C187800100048 
           the isotopes in the cocktail beam.                     C187800100049
