SAMPLE     (12-MG-26,ENR=0.994) 26Mg foils (99.4% isotopic        C2281  1   13 
           abundance, 3.5-3.9 mg/cm2 thick, ~ 1 mg total          C2281  1   14 
           material).                                             C2281  1   15

METHOD     (AMS) Stacks of up to three foils were bombarded with  C2281  1   17 
           protons. After the irradiation, known amounts of 27A1  C2281  1   18 
           powder (15-25 mg Al) were added to each of the 26Mg    C2281  1   19 
           foils. It is assumed that the 26Al produced in the     C2281  1   20 
           26Mg foils is converted to Al203 with the same         C2281  1   21 
           efficiency as the added 27Al. The MgO + Al203 powder   C2281  1   22 
            (16-40 mg) was then thoroughly mixed with 140 mg Zn   C2281  1   23 
           powder and pressed to solid pellets of 6.4 mm          C2281  1   24 
           diameter, which were mounted to the 10-position cone   C2281  1   25 
           wheel of the inverted Cs-beam sputter source at the    C2281  1   26 
           Argonne tandem. The split-pole focal plane detector    C2281  1   27 
           is a position sensitive ionization chamber which       C2281  1   28 
           generates position, differential energy loss and       C2281  1   29 
           total energy signals, thus allowing complete mass and  C2281  1   30 
           nuclear charge identification.                         C2281  1   31 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The main contributions to the errors arise  C2281  1   32
