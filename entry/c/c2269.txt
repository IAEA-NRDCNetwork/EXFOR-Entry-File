SAMPLE     10B target with thickness of 200 mu-g/cm2 was bombardedC2269  1   13 
           by 24Mg ions to produce nuclei of interest 32Cl        C2269  1   14 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays emitted from recoiling heavy nuclei  C2269  1   15 
           were detected by Gammasphere, which consisted of 98    C2269  1   16 
           Compton suppressed high-purity Ge detectors covering   C2269  1   17 
           nearly whole solid angle 4Pi.                          C2269  1   18 
           (MAGSP) Ions recoiling from the target were separated  C2269  1   19 
           from the beam and dispersed by the Argonne Fragment    C2269  1   20 
           Mass Analyzer, which selects recoils according to      C2269  1   21

           (PGAC) Parallel-grid avalanche counter was located at  C2269  1   23 
           the focal plane of the FMA to determine                C2269  1   24 
           mass-to-charge ratio of the reaction products by       C2269  1   25

           (IOCH) Ions were stopped in an ionization chamber      C2269  1   27 
           filled with isobutane gas at 13 Torr. The IC was       C2269  1   28 
           divided into three segments (5, 5, and 20 cm long,     C2269  1   29 
           respectively) to facilitate particle identification    C2269  1   30

INC-SOURCE Excited states in 32Cl nucleus were produced via       C2269  1   32 
           nuclear reaction 10B(24Mg,2n)32Cl by bombarding 10B    C2269  1   33 
           target with 24Mg ions. Ions recoiling from the target  C2269  1   34 
           were separated from the beam and dispersed by the      C2269  1   35

ANALYSIS   Excited states of 32Cl were studied by gamma           C2269  1   37 
           spectroscopy. The unbound states at 1738.1 and 2130.5  C2269  1   38 
           keV in 32Cl correspond to 156 and 549 keV resonances   C2269  1   39 
           in the 31S(p,gamma)32Cl reaction and their properties  C2269  1   40 
           dominate the 31S(p,gamma)32Cl reaction rate. Gamma-ray C2269  1   41 
           partial widths were inferred based upon properties of  C2269  1   42 
           mirror states in 32P                                   C2269  1   43 
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification C2269  1   44 
           (COINC) Coincidence between gamma rays and recoil ions C2269  1   45 
           was required                                           C2269  1   46
