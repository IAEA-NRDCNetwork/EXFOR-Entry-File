                                                described.        C193700100018 
FACILITY   (LASER,1USAROC) Measurement performed at the           C193700100019 
           University of Rochester OMEGA Laser Facility.          C193700100020 
SAMPLE     The target was a CH plastic shell of thickness 15 -    C193700100021 
           30 mu-m and an outer diameter of approximately 1 mm,   C193700100022 
           filled with 15 atm of gaseous D-T fuel in a ratio of   C193700100023 
           D/T approx. 65/35.                                     C193700100024 
METHOD     D-T reaction under condition of inertial confinement   C193700100025 
           fusion (ICF) was used to determine n/gamma branching.  C193700100026 
           To achieve D+T implosions, 60 laser beams at wavelengthC193700100027 
           of 351 nm, with a total energy of 23 - 28 kJ, were     C193700100028 
           focused on the target at chamber center (TCC) for a    C193700100029 
           duration of 1 ns. Gamma rays produced in D+T->5He      C193700100030 
           reaction and neutrons produced in D+T -> 4He + n       C193700100031 
           were directly measured.                                C193700100032 
DETECTOR   Two gas Cherenkov detectors were used to detect high   C193700100033 
           energy gamma rays. One of them used 1.5-cm-thick and   C193700100034 
           7-cm-diameter beryllium disk to convert gamma rays to  C193700100035 
           Compton electrons and pressurized CO2 (variable up to  C193700100036 
           100 psi) as Cherenkov radiator. Cherenkov light was    C193700100037 
           relayed via Cassegranian optics to a Photek ultrafast  C193700100038 
           microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube (MCP). CO2 gas C193700100039 
           pressure was fixed at 100 psia corresponding to a      C193700100040 
           Cherenkov production energy threshold of 6.3 MeV.      C193700100041 
           The second Cherenkov counter used Al converter and SF6 C193700100042 
           gas at pressure of 87 psia as Cherenkov radiator.      C193700100043 
           Energy threshold was 5 MeV.                            C193700100044 
           (SCIN) Neutrons from D+T reaction were detected using  C193700100045 
           ultrafast scintillators BC-422 and BC-422Q coupled to  C193700100046 
           either a single-stage (gain up to 1E+3) MCP PMT and/or C193700100047 
           a two-stage (gain up to 1E+6) MCP PMT.                 C193700100048 
           Another neutron detector prototype was based on a      C193700100049 
           synthetic diamond wafer produced by the chemical vapor C193700100050 
           deposition.                                            C193700100051
