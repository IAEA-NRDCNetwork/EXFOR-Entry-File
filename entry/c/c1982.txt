DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus          C198200100016 
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800     C198200100017 
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array   C198200100018 
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3      C198200100019 
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10    C198200100020 
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the     C198200100021 
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm, C198200100022 
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,           C198200100023 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C198200100024 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C198200100025 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C198200100026 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C198200100027 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C198200100028 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C198200100029 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C198200100030 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C198200100031 
           cm thick lead shield.                                  C198200100032 
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) The gamma rays in coincidence with   C198200100033 
           the breakup events were measured using the NSCL        C198200100034 
           position-sensitive NaI(Tl) array of 38 detectors       C198200100035
