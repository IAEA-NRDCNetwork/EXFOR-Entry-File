FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USATNL)Experiment performed at the HIgS        C199300100009 
           facility at Duke University                            C199300100010 
SAMPLE     Sample was superheated C4F10 liquid. The length of     C199300100011 
           the liquid target irradiated by the beam was           C199300100012 
           determined to be 3.0+-0.1 cm.                          C199300100013 
DETECTOR   (BUBLC) The buble chamber was used for the first time  C199300100014 
           for cross section measurement. The sample and at the   C199300100015 
           same time the buble chamber medium - the C4F10 liquid  C199300100016 
           was contained in a cylindrical glass vessel with a     C199300100017 
           length of 10.2 cm and an outer diameter of 3.8 cm.     C199300100018 
           Detector is insensitive to a gamma ray beam at least   C199300100019 
           at a level of one part in 1E+9. Pictures of the        C199300100020 
           superheated liquid were taken at 10 ms intervals by    C199300100021 
           two CCD cameras mounted at 90deg relative to each      C199300100022 
           other. The images were analyzed in real time by a      C199300100023 
           computer and when a bubble was detected, the pressure  C199300100024 
           in the glass vessel was increased within 40 ms of      C199300100025 
           bubble formation from 160 to 900 kPa. This led to a    C199300100026 
           quenching of the growing bubble thus preventing a      C199300100027 
           boiling runaway of the liquid. The size of the         C199300100028 
           bubbles was typically 1 to 2 mm and their location     C199300100029 
           could be determined to a precision better than 1 mm.   C199300100030 
METHOD     The 15N(alpha,gamma)19F reaction was studied via the   C199300100031 
           time inverse 19F(gamma,alpha)15N process.              C199300100032 
INC-SOURCE (LCS) Narrow bandwidth photon beam was generated by    C199300100033 
           intracavity Compton backscattering of                  C199300100034 
           free-electron-laser light from high-energy electron    C199300100035 
           beam bunches circulating in electron storage ring.     C199300100036 
ANALYSIS   (DTBAL) Cross sections were obtained using the         C199300100037 
           reciprocity theorem for nuclear reactions, which       C199300100038 
           relates the cross sections of forward and time-inverse C199300100039 
           nuclear processes.                                     C199300100040
