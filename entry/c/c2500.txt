SAMPLE     12 targets were made by electrodepositing neptunium    C2500  1   15 
           from aliquots of this solution containing 150-250      C2500  1   16 
           microg of 237Np on 2.5-microm molybdenum foils in a    C2500  1   17 
           1.23-cm area for each target. Measured target          C2500  1   18 
           thicknesses ranged from 118 to 142 microg/cm2. Each    C2500  1   19 
           foil was mounted on a target holder frame, and ten of  C2500  1   20 
           the target holder frames were mounted in the LIM       C2500  1   21 
           Target System, with a spacing of approximately 1 cm    C2500  1   22 
           between the targets. A 25-microm beryllium foil        C2500  1   23 
           served as the volume limiting foil (which confines     C2500  1   24 
           the gas volume downstream of the last target to the    C2500  1   25 
           same as that for the rest of the targets) for the LIM  C2500  1   26 
           Target System, and another 25-microm beryllium foil    C2500  1   27 
           upstream of the targets served as the vacuum window    C2500  1   28 
           for the system.                                        C2500  1   29

METHOD     (CHSEP,XSPEC) Radiochemical and K X-ray measurements.  C2500  1   32 
           Two different chemical separations were performed on   C2500  1   33 
           the reaction products of these irradiations. The       C2500  1   34 
           first separation was designed to determine the         C2500  1   35 
           elemental assignment of the fission activity, the      C2500  1   36 
           second was used to produce an americium sample         C2500  1   37 
           suitable for measurement of the plutonium K x-rays     C2500  1   38
