           prepared using a 20-ton hydraulic press. The absolute  C2350  6    7 
           yield targets consisted of a stack of two 25 microm    C2350  6    8 
           Al foils serving as the monitor and catcher, the       C2350  6    9 
           target pellet or foil, and a final 25 microm Al        C2350  6   10 
           catcher foil. The target stacks were carefully         C2350  6   11 
           aligned and sealed in a 100 microm Al guarding         C2350  6   12
