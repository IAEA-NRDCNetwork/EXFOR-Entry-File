FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) 60-inch cyclotron of the Crocker       C2298  1    8 
           Laboratory.                                            C2298  1    9 
SAMPLE     The target used for this work contained about 10**13   C2298  1   10 
           atoms of monoisotopic Cf249 in addition to about       C2298  1   11 
           2x10**13 atoms of its parent Bk249.                    C2298  1   12 
METHOD     (CHSEP,REC,ACTIV) Immediately after bombardment, the   C2298  1   13 
           californium and einsteinium reaction products were     C2298  1   14 
           separated by ion-exchange methods and                  C2298  1   15 
           electrodeposited on platinum foil for examination by   C2298  1   16 
           alpha pulse-height analysis.                           C2298  1   17 
ANALYSIS   The approximate cross sections were calculated from    C2298  1   18 
           the observed alpha-disintegration rates and branching  C2298  1   19 
           ratios, assuming recoil collection yields of 100% in   C2298  1   20 
           the bombardments.                                      C2298  1   21
