ANALYSIS   Cross sections were calculated from the activation     C3039001   23 
           equation for thin foils. After the AEOB was obtained   C3039001   24 
           from HPGe, the cross section is sigma=AEoB/(I*n*x*(1 - C3039001   25 
           exp(-lambda*tirrad))), where I is the number of        C3039001   26 
           incident particles per unit time, n is the target      C3039001   27 
           nuclei per unit volume, x is the target thickness,     C3039001   28 
           lambda is the radionuclide decay constant, and tirrad  C3039001   29 
           is the irradiation time.                               C3039001   30 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) All uncertainties in this work correspond to   C3039001   31 
           values within one standard deviations of the mean.     C3039001   32 
           The uncertainty in measured radionuclide activities    C3039001   33 
           was calculated by the standard deviation of the        C3039001   34 
           activities measured in each of several HPGe            C3039001   35 
           measurements. These standard deviations are larger     C3039001   36 
           than the uncertainties calculated by error             C3039001   37
