SAMPLE     (3-LI-6,ENR=0.956) Lithium target 0.685 cm thick.      C191400100012 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) A magnetic spectrometer was used to detect     C191400100013 
           charged particles in coincidence with outgoing         C191400100014 
           protons, which were stopped in a range telescope.      C191400100015

METHOD     (CHARG,MASSP,TOF) Spark chambers were used to          C191400100017 
           determine the scattering angle and reconstruct the     C191400100018 
           trajectories of the charged particles through the      C191400100019 
           magnetic field. Plastic scintillator counters were     C191400100020 
           used to trigger the spark chambers and to measure the  C191400100021 
           time of flight of the charged particles. The mass      C191400100022 
           separation of the spectrometer was 10%, enabling       C191400100023 
           deuterons to be easily separated from other particles. C191400100024 
ANALYSIS   (DIFFR) Data were taken and analyzed under two         C191400100025 
           different conditions: copper absorber thickness and    C191400100026 
           magnetic field appropriate to an average value of      C191400100027 
           transverse recoil momentum. The missing energy         C191400100028 
           spectra for these two conditions were deduced. The     C191400100029 
           transmission of the system, for a given recoil         C191400100030 
           momentum, was calculated both by numerical             C191400100031 
           integration over the solid angles and energy           C191400100032 
           acceptance and by Monte Carlo simulation. A small      C191400100033 
           correction for multiple scattering (5%) was            C191400100034 
           calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation. These      C191400100035 
           results were used to deduced cross sections.           C191400100036
