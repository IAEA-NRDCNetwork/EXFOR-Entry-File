FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS) Experiment performed at the external   C186300100009 
           proton beam from the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility C186300100010 
METHOD     (TRN)                                                  C186300100011 
INC-SOURCE Incident protons with energy of 800 MeV elastically    C186300100012 
           scattered on hydrogen at an angle of 17.5deg           C186300100013 
           resulted in secondary proton beam with energy of 700   C186300100014 
           MeV. Liquid hydrogen 2cm target cell was enclosed in   C186300100015 
           a scattering chamber with 0.051 mm Mylar windows.      C186300100016 
           Scattered protons were collimated by 40 cm long lead   C186300100017 
           collimator with aperture of 5cm x 5cm.                 C186300100018 
           The incident beam of protons elastically scattered     C186300100019 
           on hydrogen was counted by a pair of multiwire         C186300100020 
           proportional chambers 16cm x 16cm immediately in       C186300100021 
           front of the calcium target.                           C186300100022 
DETECTOR   (MWPC) Charged particles produced in interaction with  C186300100023 
           Ca target were detected by a pair of multiwire         C186300100024 
           chambers 32cm x 32cm located about 12 cm behind the    C186300100025 
           target. Proton interactions in the calcium target      C186300100026 
           which produced only a neutral particle could not be    C186300100027 
           detected. Largest detected scattering angle was 62deg. C186300100028 
ANALYSIS   The total reaction cross sections were obtained        C186300100029 
           by integration over all angles of the inelastic        C186300100030 
           differential cross section and by extrapolation of     C186300100031 
           those cross sections to zero degrees.                  C186300100032 
           The single reaction channel which produces only a      C186300100033 
           neutral particle in the final state is the (p,n)       C186300100034 
           reaction and has been estimated to be about 2% of      C186300100035 
           the total reaction cross section for                   C186300100036 
           660 MeV protons on medium-weight nuclei.               C186300100037
