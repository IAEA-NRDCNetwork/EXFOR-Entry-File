FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Measurement was performed at the       C182800100012 
           Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) radioactive   C182800100013 
           beam facility, TRIUMF.                                 C182800100014 
SAMPLE     Two (CH2)n targets were used during the experiment withC182800100015 
           thicknesses of 32+-2 and 34+-2 mu-g/cm2, respectively. C182800100016 
           The hydrogen content of the target was monitored by    C182800100017 
           measuring the ratio of hydrogen to carbon recoils      C182800100018 
           scattered, at a given angle, by the beam. When the     C182800100019 
           ratio dropped significantly, the target was replaced.  C182800100020 
INC-SOURCE High-intensity 18F4+ beam with average 5 x 10E+6 pps   C182800100021 
           from ISAC was used.The 18-O contamination in the beam  C182800100022 
           was monitored throughout the experiment and dropped    C182800100023 
           from an initial 70% (during 673 keV runs) to less      C182800100024 
           than 5% during the 250 keV data runs.                  C182800100025 
DETECTOR   (SISD) Coincident alpha-particle and heavy-ion         C182800100026 
           products were detected by highly segmented silicon     C182800100027 
           strip detector arrays, providing particle energy,      C182800100028 
           time-of-flight, and scattering angle information. One  C182800100029 
           silicon strip detector array (LEDA-2) was positioned   C182800100030 
           upstream covering laboratory angles from 120 to 146    C182800100031 
           deg. Three further silicon strip detector arrays       C182800100032 
            (LEDA-1,S2-1,S2-2) covered downstream laboratory      C182800100033 
           angles from 4 to 69deg.                                C182800100034
