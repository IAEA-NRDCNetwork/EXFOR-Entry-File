METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Chemical separations were carried out    C2365  1   13 
           on all of the targets. The gamma radiations of the     C2365  1   14 
           four isotopes of interest were determined with a       C2365  1   15 
           calibrated Ge(Li) detector at a low geometry so that   C2365  1   16 
           the loss of counting rate in the photopeak due to      C2365  1   17 
           summing with coincident radiation was negligible. The  C2365  1   18 
           decay of each nuclide was followed for a minimum of    C2365  1   19 
           two half-lives.                                        C2365  1   20 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curves were analyzed by a            C2365  1   21 
           least squares computer program in order to obtain the  C2365  1   22 
           activities and their standard deviations at end-of-    C2365  1   23 
           bombardment time.                                      C2365  1   24 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The error estimates given for the mean         C2365  1   25 
           values were obtained by root-mean-square addition of   C2365  1   26 
           these individual errors and of the standard deviation  C2365  1   27 
           of the mean.                                           C2365  1   28

CORRECTION Since relatively thin target foils were used in these  C2365  1   32 
           experiments (65 to 97 mg/cm2), it was necessary to     C2365  1   33 
           correct all measured cross sections for recoil losses. C2365  1   34
