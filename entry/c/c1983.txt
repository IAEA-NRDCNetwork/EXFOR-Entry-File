DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus          C198300100017 
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800     C198300100018 
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array   C198300100019 
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3      C198300100020 
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10    C198300100021 
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the     C198300100022 
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm, C198300100023 
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,           C198300100024 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C198300100025 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C198300100026 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C198300100027 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C198300100028 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C198300100029 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C198300100030 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C198300100031 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C198300100032 
           cm thick lead shield.                                  C198300100033 
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) After selection in the A1200         C198300100034 
           fragment separator, the secondary beam of 60           C198300100035 
           MeV/nucleon (midtarget energy) was directed onto a     C198300100036 
           228 mg/cm2 9Be reaction target surrounded by a         C198300100037 
           position-sensitive NaI array. This array detected the  C198300100038 
           gamma rays emitted by excited fragments, while the     C198300100039 
           emerging 10Be fragments were measured and identified   C198300100040 
           by the S800 spectrometer, operated in the              C198300100041 
           dispersion-matched mode.                               C198300100042 
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The response functions corresponding to the      C198300100043 
           individual gamma rays were generated with the Monte    C198300100044 
           Carlo code GEANT in a simulation procedure that took   C198300100045 
           into account both the Doppler shift and the            C198300100046 
           distortion of the shapes caused by the                 C198300100047 
           backtransformation. The experimental efficiencies      C198300100048 
           measured with calibrated radioactive sources agreed    C198300100049 
           with the simulations to within 5%. The calculated      C198300100050 
           line shapes, together with an assumed smooth           C198300100051 
           background arising from neutrons and debris from the   C198300100052 
           target, give the excellent fit to the measured         C198300100053 
           spectrum.                                              C198300100054

           (ERR-1) the absolute gamma branching ratios in         C198300100056 
           coincidence with projectile residue intensities are    C198300100057 
           reliable to better than 10%.                           C198300100058 
           (ERR-2) The error in the cross sections includes a     C198300100059 
           common 15% scale error.                                C198300100060
