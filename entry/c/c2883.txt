FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 88-Inch Cyclotron at Berkeley.     C2883001   11 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) 3-in. diam 3-in. long NaI(Tl) crystal and a    C2883001   12 
           400-channel pulse-height analyzer. A collection of     C2883001   13 
           threshold detectors was used: 58Ni(n,p)58Co,           C2883001   14 
           59Co(n,alpha)56Mn, 65Cu(n,p)65Ni, 27Al(n,alpha)24Na,   C2883001   15 
           203Th(n,2n)202Tl, 127I(n,2n)126I, and 58Ni(n,2n)57Ni.  C2883001   16 
SAMPLE     The target was made of tantalum, and measured 2.5 in.  C2883001   17 
           in diameter and 0.25 in. thick. This dimension was     C2883001   18 
           adequate for stopping the alpha particles and for      C2883001   19 
           covering the end of the copper Faraday cup in which    C2883001   20 
           it was mounted.                                        C2883001   21 
METHOD     (TTM) The experiment involved a target of a selected   C2883001   22 
           material, a means of measuring the beam particle       C2883001   23 
           current, the selected threshold detectors, a device    C2883001   24 
           to mount the detectors at predetermined positions,     C2883001   25 
           and a means to suppress secondary emission electrons   C2883001   26 
           from escaping the current-measuring device. Each       C2883001   27 
           threshold detector was counted at 3.0 cm from the      C2883001   28 
           actual face of the NaI crystal. The resultant          C2883001   29 
           gamma-ray spectra were used during the reduction of    C2883001   30 
           the data.                                              C2883001   31 
CORRECTION The total counts in the photopeak were corrected for   C2883001   32 
           decay and saturation. A correction was made for the    C2883001   33 
           abundance of the gamma ray for the decay scheme for    C2883001   34 
           each type of disintegration. The data were corrected   C2883001   35 
           for counting geometry and total absolute efficiency    C2883001   36 
           for the size of the NaI crystal, gamma-ray energies    C2883001   37 
           distance of the sample from the crystal, and sample    C2883001   38 
           size and thickness.                                    C2883001   39

CORRECTION Conversion from photopeak counts to neutron flux is    C2883002    8 
           considered to be +-15%. All variations affect the      C2883002    9 
           entire set of threshold detector data and do not       C2883002   10 
           change the shape of the curve. The beam current was    C2883002   11 
           known to +-3%, and detector angular location was +-1%. C2883002   12
