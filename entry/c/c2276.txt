FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Measurements were performed with the    C2276  1   11 
           FN Tandem Accelerator at the University of Notre Dame  C2276  1   12

SAMPLE     (68-ER-162,ENR=0.282) Material enriched with 162Er     C2276  1   14 
           was purchased in an oxide form Er2O3. The oxide form   C2276  1   15 
           of enriched 162Er was deposited onto a 40mu-g/cm2      C2276  1   16 
           carbon backing by an electron beam gun evaporator.     C2276  1   17 
           Eight targets were produced with thicknesses between   C2276  1   18 
           65 and 130 mu-g/cm2 Target frames were made of Ta,     C2276  1   19 
           with 1 cm diameter holes.                              C2276  1   20 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Targets were counted offline by a high-purity   C2276  1   21 
           germanium detector of 40% relative efficiency.         C2276  1   22 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used.The reaction yields C2276  1   23 
           were determined by the observed activity of produced   C2276  1   24 
           isotopes. The whole setup was shielded by 10 cm thick  C2276  1   25 
           lead  shield against laboratory background.            C2276  1   26
