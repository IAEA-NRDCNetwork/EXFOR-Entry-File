DETECTOR   (IOCH,GEMUC,PROPC) An argon-filled ionization chamber  C2885001    9 
           attached to a scaling circuit was used for gross       C2885001   10 
           alpha counting of tracers and plutonium assays. This   C2885001   11 
           instrument has a counting efficiency of 52% for thin   C2885001   12 
           samples. All the fission products were beta-particle   C2885001   13 
           emitters and counted on a Geiger-Muller counter. The   C2885001   14 
           counting unit used was an end window Amperex 100 C     C2885001   15 
           tube filled with a mixture of chlorine and argon.      C2885001   16 
           Isotopes decaying by electron capture were counted in  C2885001   17 
           a Nucleometer. This instrument contains a methane      C2885001   18 
           flow-type windowless proportional counter.             C2885001   19 
METHOD     (CHSEP) Extensive chemical procedures are necessary    C2885001   20 
           because of the many possible reactions induced in the  C2885001   21 
           target material Itself and in the aluminum backing     C2885001   22 
           plate. Because of the small amount of valuable target  C2885001   23 
           material available and the low counting rates that     C2885001   24 
           were present in products in many cases, it was not     C2885001   25 
           possible to take aliquots. A known amount of           C2885001   26 
           alpha-emitting isotope was added to the target         C2885001   27 
           solution for each actinide that was to be taken out.   C2885001   28 
           Yield was determined from the amount of that           C2885001   29 
           particular isotope remaining in the isolated actinide. C2885001   30 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Energy and half-life data were used to         C2885001   31 
           identify isotopes. Energy data was used solely in      C2885001   32 
           determining the amount, on each counting plate, of     C2885001   33 
           alpha-emitting isotope that was added for yield        C2885001   34 
           determination. Usually the beta-particle emitters and  C2885001   35 
           electron-capture isotopes were identified by their     C2885001   36 
           half-lives which were resolved from decay curves.      C2885001   37 
           This could not be done for Am237 and Am238. These      C2885001   38 
           isotopes were separated by the method of least         C2885001   39 
           squares, an analytical method of separating decay      C2885001   40 
           curve components.                                      C2885001   41
