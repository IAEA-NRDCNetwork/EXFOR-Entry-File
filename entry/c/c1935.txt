DETECTOR   (GE-IN) The scattered helions were detected using a    C193500100011 
           dE-E telescope consisting of intrinsic germanium       C193500100012 
           detectors of 1 cm thickness. A rectangular slit of     C193500100013 
           0.4x1 cm2 placed in front of the detectors defined     C193500100014 
           the angular acceptance of the detectors as 0.3         C193500100015 
           degrees in Theta. An overall energy resolution of      C193500100016 
           600-700 keV FWHM was achieved.                         C193500100017

METHOD     (EDE) Using both hardware and software constraints,    C193500100019 
           we restricted the measurements to cover the            C193500100020 
           excitation-energy range of O-40 MeV in the nuclei      C193500100021 
           studied. Whenever the elastic event rates were very    C193500100022 
           high, signals corresponding to elastic events were     C193500100023 
           electronically blocked before entering the data        C193500100024 
           acquisition computer. Data were obtained in the        C193500100025 
           angular range 7-20 degrees for 208Pb and 7.5-20        C193500100026 
           degrees for 58Ni targets. Measurements were carried    C193500100027 
           out in steps of 0.5-1.5 degrees, depending upon the    C193500100028 
           angular region. In order to obtain clean inelastic     C193500100029 
           spectra special care was taken to achieve a            C193500100030 
           good-quality halo-free beam on target. This condition  C193500100031 
           was periodically checked by replacing the target with  C193500100032 
           an empty frame. The resulting background counting      C193500100033 
           rate was minimized before data were obtained at every  C193500100034 
           angle.                                                 C193500100035 
ANALYSIS   The broad Giant Resonances (GR) structures ride on a   C193500100036 
           background continuum. In the present work we assumed   C193500100037 
           the background shapes were obtained by joining         C193500100038 
           smoothly the data points from the structure-free       C193500100039 
           excitation region above Ex = 25-30 MeV to the region   C193500100040 
           below the GR bump at Ex = 7-10 MeV, depending on the   C193500100041 
           target nucleus.   At these helion-energies cross       C193500100042 
           sections must be corrected for reaction losses in the  C193500100043 
           Ge detectors. Rather than estimate the losses, we      C193500100044 
           have normalized the sigma(theta) values obtained to    C193500100045 
           earlier, precise measurements made using the IUCF      C193500100046 
           magnetic spectrometer.                                 C193500100047 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The main source of uncertainty in the cross    C193500100048 
           section for GR excitation in the uncertainty with      C193500100049 
           which continuum cross section can be specified. The    C193500100050 
           error in cross sections for GR structures varies       C193500100051 
           between 15-30% depending upon the relative strength of C193500100052 
           the GR structure compared to the continuum background. C193500100053 
           Besides, normalization procedure led to an uncertainty C193500100054 
           of 5 percent in sigma(theta) values obtained here. The C193500100055 
           data points have statistical errors of the order of 5%.C193500100056
