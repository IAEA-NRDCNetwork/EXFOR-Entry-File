FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAINU) Experiment performed using separated-  C195500100008 
           sector isochronous cyclotron at the Indiana            C195500100009 
           University Cyclotron Facility.                         C195500100010 
SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.9914) Several enriched 208Pb targets  C195500100011 
           with thickness of 10 - 200 mg/cm2 were used            C195500100012 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Several Si surface barrier detectors with      C195500100013 
           efficiencies of 7 - 15 % were used to measure alpha    C195500100014 
           activity of product nucleus 211At.                     C195500100015 
METHOD     (ACTIV,RCHEM) Activation method was used. Samples      C195500100016 
           irradiated for periods from 2 to 8 hours were          C195500100017 
           radiochemically separated and their alpha activity     C195500100018 
           determined. The radiochemical yields were              C195500100019 
           typically 35 %.                                        C195500100020 
ANALYSIS   Two alpha decay branches at energies of 5.87 and       C195500100021 
           7.45 MeV were measured, final result is the average    C195500100022
