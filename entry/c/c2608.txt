INC-SPECT  The negative pions are produced in the large Chicago   C2608  1    9 
           cyclotron by protons of 450 MeV striking a target      C2608  1   10 
           which in some of the experiments was copper and in     C2608  1   11 
           others beryllium. A sharply collimated beam            C2608  1   12 
           containing pions with energy defined within ~3         C2608  1   13 
           percent. In addition to the pions this beam contains   C2608  1   14 
           some muons and electrons of the same momentum. Their   C2608  1   15 
           number has been determined from a range curve. The     C2608  1   16 
           muons amount to between 5 percent and 10 percent. The  C2608  1   17 
           electrons are present in negligible numbers for beams  C2608  1   18 
           above 100 MeV. Below this energy the electron          C2608  1   19 
           contamination increases rapidly. For this reason low   C2608  1   20 
           energy measurements have been taken by reducing with   C2608  1   21 
           a beryllium absorber the energy of the 122-MeV beam.   C2608  1   22 
SAMPLE     A glass cylinder 3 inches in diameter and 7.5 inches   C2608  1   23 
           long, closed by 0.005-inch copper windows. This        C2608  1   24 
           chamber can be alternately filled with and emptied of  C2608  1   25 
           liquid hydrogen.                                       C2608  1   26 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two scintillation crystals of 1-inch-square     C2608  1   27 
           cross section separated by a distance of about one     C2608  1   28 
           meter. A pair of liquid scintillation counters.        C2608  1   29 
METHOD     (COINC) The coincidences of these two scintillation    C2608  1   30 
           counters indicate the number of particles entering     C2608  1   31 
           the equipment. Beyond the second crystal the pions     C2608  1   32 
           enter the scattering chamber. The particles which are  C2608  1   33 
           not scattered out of the beam are recorded by the      C2608  1   34 
           coincidences which they give in a pair of liquid       C2608  1   35 
           scintillation counters. The double coincidence rate    C2608  1   36 
           of the first two scintillators is recorded and at the  C2608  1   37 
           same time the quadruple coincidence rate of all four   C2608  1   38 
           scintillators. The attenuation of the beam is          C2608  1   39 
           obtained from a comparison of the ratio of the         C2608  1   40 
           quadruple to double coincidence counts with and        C2608  1   41 
           without the hydrogen and is computed as a cross        C2608  1   42 
           section.                                               C2608  1   43

CORRECTION A number of corrections have been applied to the       C2608  1   45 
           results on account of the following effects:           C2608  1   46 
            (1) Background due to accidentals (usually 1 percent  C2608  1   47 
           or less).                                              C2608  1   48 
            (2) Angular spread of the beam due to geometry,       C2608  1   49 
           diffraction scattering, and pi-mu decay. In some       C2608  1   50 
           experiments the multiple scattering was compensated    C2608  1   51 
           by means of an equivalent aluminum foil; in others it  C2608  1   52 
           was computed. This correction is important only at     C2608  1   53 
           low energies.                                          C2608  1   54 
            (3) Muon and electron component in the original beam. C2608  1   55 
           It is assumed that muons and electrons suer only       C2608  1   56 
           Coulomb scattering and have no specific nuclear        C2608  1   57 
           interaction.                                           C2608  1   58 
            (4) Correction for scattered particles                C2608  1   59 
           recorded by the end counters. This correction was      C2608  1   60 
           computed on the assumption of isotropic scattering in  C2608  1   61 
           the center-of-mass system. It amounted to between 4    C2608  1   62 
           percent and 2 percent depending on whether the recoil  C2608  1   63 
           protons are or are not recorded. The correction would  C2608  1   64 
           be larger if the scattering were predominately         C2608  1   65 
           forward but smaller if charge exchange scattering      C2608  1   66 
           were important.                                        C2608  1   67
