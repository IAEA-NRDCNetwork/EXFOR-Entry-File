FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 88-   C2543  1   10 
           inch cyclotron.                                        C2543  1   11 
SAMPLE     The targets used in this experiment consisted of 90    C2543  1   12 
           to 100 microg/29Si02 evaporated onto 1.9 cm diameter,  C2543  1   13 
           0.013 mm thick Ta foil backings.                       C2543  1   14 
DETECTOR   (GELI)                                                 C2543  1   15 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) Each target was irradiated within 180    C2543  1   16 
           beam of one of eight energies 30,40,50,58.5,70,80,87   C2543  1   17 
           and 99 MeV which was provided by the Lawrence          C2543  1   18 
           Berkeley Laboratory 88-inch cyclotron. The length of   C2543  1   19 
           the irradiation period varied between 45 and 60        C2543  1   20 
           minutes. The Sc nuclei produced by the reaction        C2543  1   21 
           recoiled into the Ta backing and were stopped. Their   C2543  1   22 
           subsequent decays were measured after the end of the   C2543  1   23 
           irradiation by gamma-ray spectroscopy using a Ge(Li)   C2543  1   24 
           detector. For beam energies above 70 MeV, the 180      C2543  1   25 
           projectile energy exceeded the Coulomb barrier of the  C2543  1   26 
           Ta target backing, allowing the production of          C2543  1   27 
           activities with large cross sections that obscured     C2543  1   28 
           those of interest. Therefore, a chemical separation    C2543  1   29 
           was performed to isolate the Sc activities from the    C2543  1   30 
           targets bombarded with the three highest energy        C2543  1   31 
           beams. The chemical separation technique involved      C2543  1   32 
           coprecipitation of Sc with LaF3.                       C2543  1   33 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Thus, by performing a standard analysis of     C2543  1   34 
           the decay curve associated with the 1157 keV           C2543  1   35 
           transition, the activity of each member of the isomer  C2543  1   36 
           pair at the end of the irradiation was calculated.     C2543  1   37 
           Using these activities and correcting for growth and   C2543  1   38 
           decay during the irradiation and for the branching     C2543  1   39 
           ratios to each decay mode, the final isomer ratios     C2543  1   40 
           were computed.                                         C2543  1   41
