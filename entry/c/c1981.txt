METHOD     (COINC,TOF) The proton beam had a polarization PB of   C198100100013 
           0.535 directed vertically upwards as it emerged from   C198100100014 
           the cyclotron. A solenoid magnet in the experimental   C198100100015 
           area was used to rotate the polarization through 90    C198100100016 
           degrees into the horizontal plane. Scattered events    C198100100017 
           were detected in the vertical plane, and asymmetries   C198100100018 
           were measured by running with the solenoid in one      C198100100019 
           polarity, and then reversing it. The                   C198100100020 
           scintillation-counter arrangement used to detect the   C198100100021 
           p-d elastically scattered events.                      C198100100022 
SAMPLE     CD2 targets were 0.056, 0.761 and 0.331 g/cm2 thick.   C198100100023 
ANALYSIS   Events due to elastic proton-deuteron scattering were  C198100100024 
           separated from background events by means of three     C198100100025 
           selection criteria: (1) coplanarity of the incoming    C198100100026 
           proton and the two final-state particles; (2) angular  C198100100027 
           correlation corresponding to the kinematics of P-d     C198100100028 
           elastic scattering; (3) time of flight of either the   C198100100029 
           final-state proton, or deuteron, or both. Once the     C198100100030 
           number of elastic events was found for each defining   C198100100031 
           bin and sign of solenoid polarity, rates per incident  C198100100032 
           beam particle were computed. Solid angles were         C198100100033 
           computed with the aid of a Monte Carlo program.        C198100100034 
CORRECTION In computing the differential cross sections, nuclear  C198100100035 
           absorption corrections of between 3% and 12% were      C198100100036 
           applied for loss of beam particles in the HV           C198100100037 
           hodoscope and target, and loss of final-state          C198100100038
