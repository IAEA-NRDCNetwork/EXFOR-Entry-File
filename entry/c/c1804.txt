FACILITY   (VDG,1USATNL) Experiment performed at the 1-MV Van de  C180400100009 
           Graaff accelerator at the Triangle Universities        C180400100010 
           Nuclear Laboratory                                     C180400100011 
SAMPLE     Sample was a 1mm thick aluminum sheet (99% purity)     C180400100012 
           with implanted  layer of 22Ne. The ion implanter       C180400100013 
           accelerated  neon ions from a pressurized natural      C180400100014 
           neon (9.25% +- 0.03%  molar fraction of 22Ne) gas      C180400100015 
           bottle to an energy of 100 keV. A 90 deg analyzing     C180400100016 
           magnet (with a quoted selectivity of 1/100) was  used  C180400100017 
           to mass separate the 22Ne ions. The incident dose of   C180400100018 
           22Ne was estimated by integrating the beam current     C180400100019 
           on the backing, assuming singly charged incident       C180400100020 
           22Ne ions. The beam current on the backing amounted    C180400100021 
           to about 20 mu-A on average. The total accumulated     C180400100022 
           charge was 0.26 C (corresponding to 1.6E+18  incident  C180400100023 
           22Ne ions) over a circular implantation region of      C180400100024 
           2.5 cm in diameter.                                    C180400100025 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Capture gamma rays from the excited compound    C180400100026 
           nuclei (28Si and 23Na) were detected using a 135%      C180400100027 
           relative efficiency HPGe detector. The detector was    C180400100028 
           located at 55 deg with respect to the  beam direction  C180400100029 
           at a distance of 3.0 cm from the center of the target. C180400100030 
METHOD     Depth profiling technique was used to determine depth  C180400100031 
           profile of 22Na ions implanted in surface layer of     C180400100032 
           27Al. Analysing the resonance gamma ray yield of       C180400100033 
           22Na(p,g) resonance at 479 keV and 27Al(p,g) resonance C180400100034 
           at 406 keV, the strength of 22Na(p,g) resonance was    C180400100035 
           determined relatively to the strength of 27Al(p,g)     C180400100036 
           resonance.                                             C180400100037
