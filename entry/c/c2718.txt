SAMPLE     Deuterium gas. Target was about 0.55 MeV thick.        C2718  1   10 
METHOD     The above cross section values were obtained from      C2718  1   11 
           measurements in a cone of approximately 45 degrees     C2718  1   12 
           about the direction of the beam. Additional            C2718  1   13 
           measurements at right angles to the beam indicate      C2718  1   14 
           that anisotropy exists in the center of mass system.   C2718  1   15 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Probable error. Each quantity involved in   C2718  1   16 
           the calculations was critically examined and an        C2718  1   17 
           estimate of the error in that quantity made. The       C2718  1   18 
           uncertainty of a given quantity is the maximum amount  C2718  1   19 
           or fraction of that quantity by which it is believed   C2718  1   20 
           the measured value could have differed from the true   C2718  1   21 
           value. If the reasonable view were taken that the      C2718  1   22 
           uncertainties connected with sigma independent of      C2718  1   23 
           each other, then their sum should be the square root   C2718  1   24 
           of the sum of their squares. This gives a total        C2718  1   25 
           root-mean-square uncertainty of 11.7% in the value of  C2718  1   26 
           any one measurement of the absolute cross section.     C2718  1   27 
CORRECTION Corrections to the cross section for the effect of     C2718  1   28 
           thick target and inhomogeneity of the beam.            C2718  1   29 
CRITIQUE   Erratum: Experiments on the reaction 20(30,240)n [1-H- C2718  1   30 
           2(HE3,P)2-HE-4] have shown a mistake in the design     C2718  1   31 
           of the ionization chamber used in the 230 [HE3]        C2718  1   32 
           experiments. Corrections can be made to the results    C2718  1   33 
           already obtained by calculating the fraction of the    C2718  1   34 
           240's [2-HE-4] emitted which reached the detecting     C2718  1   35 
           region with sufficient energy (about 330 keV by        C2718  1   36 
           experiment) to be detected. In other words, the the    C2718  1   37 
           solid angle in which particles were detected was not   C2718  1   38 
           determined entirely by the collimating system but also C2718  1   39 
           by the variation of the range of the emitted particles C2718  1   40 
           with angle and bombarding energy. A crude estimate of  C2718  1   41 
           the necessary correction factor to the data reported isC2718  1   42 
            1.02 for an average energy of 0.9 MeV, increasing to  C2718  1   43 
           1.47 at 0.475 MeV. In making these estimates it was    C2718  1   44 
           assumed that the energy loss in the collection region  C2718  1   45 
           necessary for a particle to be detected was 0.8 MeV    C2718  1   46 
           which has turned out to be too high, in view of some   C2718  1   47 
           recent experiments. No recalculation is being made at  C2718  1   48 
           this time, however, since the entire problem requires  C2718  1   49 
           careful and detailed examination.                      C2718  1   50
