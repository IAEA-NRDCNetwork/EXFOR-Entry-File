SAMPLE     A natural mixture of Ca isotopes was used for          C0249  1   15 
           irradiation. The target was pressed in the shape of a  C0249  1   16 
           rectangular wafer (15x4x1.5 mm) from calcium carbonate.C0249  1   17

METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The target was irradiated in the         C0249  1   21 
           internal beam of the synchrocyclotron of the Joint     C0249  1   22 
           Institute for Nuclear Research for 15 to 20 min. The   C0249  1   23 
           proton beam was parallel to the 1.5 mm side of the     C0249  1   24 
           target. The incident proton energy was varied by       C0249  1   25 
           positioning the target at different radii in the       C0249  1   26 
           accelerator chamber. The irradiated target was         C0249  1   27 
           dissolved in a small amount of diluted HC1 with ~ l0   C0249  1   28 
           mg of Sc carrier. After CO2 has been removed by        C0249  1   29 
           boiling the solution, scandium hydroxide was           C0249  1   30 
           precipitated by addition of NH4OH. Then the calcium    C0249  1   31 
           and scandium fraction were purified radiochemically.   C0249  1   32 
           The proton beam intensity was determined by the yield  C0249  1   33 
           of the A127(p,3pn)Na24 reaction. The target was        C0249  1   34 
           wrapped in three layers of 20 micron aluminum foil.    C0249  1   35 
           To measure the Na24 activity, middle layers on both    C0249  1   36 
           sides of the target were used. The layers had been     C0249  1   37 
           cut strictly to the size of the target. The            C0249  1   38 
           difference in the activities of these foils did not    C0249  1   39 
           exceed 10% and amounted on the average to some 5%.     C0249  1   40 
           The ratio of absolute activities of the reaction       C0249  1   41 
           products and Na24 was derived by comparing the         C0249  1   42 
           intensities of characteristic gamma-lines, taking      C0249  1   43 
           into account the decay schemes and the efficiency of   C0249  1   44 
           counting.                                              C0249  1   45
