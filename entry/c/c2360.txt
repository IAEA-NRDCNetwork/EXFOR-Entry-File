FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USAANL) The Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) at C236000100009 
           the Argonne National Laboratory.                       C236000100010 
SAMPLE     One was a disc 3.17 cm in diameter and 0.125 cm thick  C236000100011 
           which was cut from polyethylene of density 0.94        C236000100012 
           g/cm3. In order to monitor the proton intensity on     C236000100013 
           the target, an aluminum foil 50 micron thick           C236000100014 
           protected by 25 micron of aluminum on each side was    C236000100015 
           taped to the target. The other two sizes were          C236000100016 
           machined from polyethylene of 0.91 g/cm3 density to    C236000100017 
           thicknesses of 1.00 cm and 2.00 cm and square cross    C236000100018 
           section 2.54 cm on an edge. These targets had a stack  C236000100019 
           of three aluminum foils 25 micron thick and two gold   C236000100020 
           foils 12 micron thick attached to, and trimmed to fit, C236000100021 
           the upstream and downstream faces of the polyethylene  C236000100022 
           for beam monitoring.                                   C236000100023 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The detector was a NaI crystal 7.6 cm in       C236000100024 
           diam. and 7.6 cm thick, and a single-channel analyzer  C236000100025 
           was set to accept counts in the photopeak region.      C236000100026 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Internal bombardments were carried out    C236000100027 
           using polyethylene target foils of 600 micro-m or 127  C236000100028 
           micro-m thickness. The 0.478 MeV gamma ray from the    C236000100029 
           decay of 7Be was used to measure the number of 7Be     C236000100030 
           nuclei produced by direct counting of intact           C236000100031 
           polyethylene samples.                                  C236000100032 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) We estimate an overall error of 5% is       C236000100033 
           associated with the 7Be results, relative to the       C236000100034 
           published values for Sigma Al(24Na) and Sigma C(llC).  C236000100035 
           The absolute error is increased to 8% when the errors  C236000100036 
           in the reference cross sections are included.          C236000100037 
CORRECTION The variation of counting efficiency over the face of  C236000100038 
           the NaI crystal was determined, and corrections of     C236000100039 
           about 2% were applied to the counting data after       C236000100040 
           taking into account the activity distribution in the   C236000100041 
           polyethylene after bombardment. An additional 0.5%     C236000100042 
           correction was applied to the gamma-ray counting       C236000100043 
           rates of the 1 cm and 2 cm thick targets for recoils   C236000100044 
           from the gold foil in contact with the upstream face.  C236000100045 
           This correction was determined from measurements on    C236000100046 
           aluminium foils which were downstream of a gold foil   C236000100047 
           during a bombardment.                                  C236000100048
