FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USAANL) The Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) at C2360  1    9 
           the Argonne National Laboratory.                       C2360  1   10 
SAMPLE     One was a disc 3.17 cm in diameter and 0.125 cm thick  C2360  1   11 
           which was cut from polyethylene of density 0.94        C2360  1   12 
           g/cm3. In order to monitor the proton intensity on     C2360  1   13 
           the target, an aluminum foil 50 micron thick           C2360  1   14 
           protected by 25 micron of aluminum on each side was    C2360  1   15 
           taped to the target. The other two sizes were          C2360  1   16 
           machined from polyethylene of 0.91 g/cm3 density to    C2360  1   17 
           thicknesses of 1.00 cm and 2.00 cm and square cross    C2360  1   18 
           section 2.54 cm on an edge. These targets had a stack  C2360  1   19 
           of three aluminum foils 25 micron thick and two gold   C2360  1   20 
           foils 12 micron thick attached to, and trimmed to fit, C2360  1   21 
           the upstream and downstream faces of the polyethylene  C2360  1   22 
           for beam monitoring.                                   C2360  1   23 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The detector was a NaI crystal 7.6 cm in       C2360  1   24 
           diam. and 7.6 cm thick, and a single-channel analyzer  C2360  1   25 
           was set to accept counts in the photopeak region.      C2360  1   26 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) Internal bombardments were carried out    C2360  1   27 
           using polyethylene target foils of 600 microm or 127   C2360  1   28 
           microm thickness. The 0.478 MeV gamma ray from the     C2360  1   29 
           decay of 7Be was used to measure the number of 7Be     C2360  1   30 
           nuclei produced by direct counting of intact           C2360  1   31 
           polyethylene samples.                                  C2360  1   32 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) We estimate an overall error of 5% is       C2360  1   33 
           associated with the 7Be results, relative to the       C2360  1   34 
           published values for Sigma Al(24Na) and Sigma C(llC).  C2360  1   35 
           The absolute error is increased to 8% when the errors  C2360  1   36 
           in the reference cross sections are included.          C2360  1   37 
CORRECTION The variation of counting efficiency over the face of  C2360  1   38 
           the NaI crystal was determined, and corrections of     C2360  1   39 
           about 2% were applied to the counting data after       C2360  1   40 
           taking into account the activity distribution in the   C2360  1   41 
           polyethylene after bombardment. An additional 0.5%     C2360  1   42 
           correction was applied to the gamma-ray counting       C2360  1   43 
           rates of the 1 cm and 2 cm thick targets for recoils   C2360  1   44 
           from the gold foil in contact with the upstream face.  C2360  1   45 
           This correction was determined from measurements on    C2360  1   46 
           aluminium foils which were downstream of a gold foil   C2360  1   47 
           during a bombardment.                                  C2360  1   48
