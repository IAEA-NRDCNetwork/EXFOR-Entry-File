DETECTOR   (IOCH,SISD,SI)The experimental setup used a hybrid     C167400100018 
           ion chamber/silicon detector system with 5 x 5 cm      C167400100019 
           active area, located 15.8 cm behind the secondary      C167400100020 
           target, with its center blocked by a 1 cm2 square      C167400100021 
           beam stopper. The silicon double surface strip         C167400100022 
           detector (DSSD) with a segmentation of 16 x 16         C167400100023 
           strips and a thickness of 491 mu-m was backed up by    C167400100024 
           a second 5 x 5 cm unsegmented detector, which served   C167400100025 
           as a veto against high-energy protons punching through C167400100026 
           the DSSD.                                              C167400100027 
           (MCPLT) A microchannel plate detector located 2.7 m    C167400100028 
           upstream of the final target position was used to      C167400100029 
           suppress the majority of beam contaminants off-line    C167400100030 
           through a time-of-flight measurement,                  C167400100031 
METHOD     (EDE) Inverse kinematics proton-transfer reaction      C167400100032 
           25Al(d,n)26Si with 25Al beam and CD2 target was used   C167400100033 
           to populate states of 26Si.                            C167400100034 
           (TOF) Time of flight allowed to achieve a beam purity  C167400100035 
           of 67% in off line analysis.                           C167400100036 
INC-SOURCE The primary beam of 24Mg bombarded a gas-cell target   C167400100037 
           containing D2 gas, creating the desired 25Al particles C167400100038 
           through the inverse kinematics 24Mg(d,n)25Al reaction. C167400100039 
           The resulting beam of 25Al at energy of 91.5 MeV  was  C167400100040 
           selected to a purity of 20% using RESOLUT - a mass     C167400100041 
           spectrometer with active beam cooling.                 C167400100042 
ANALYSIS   Resonance parameters of 26Si were determined using     C167400100043 
           inverse kinematics reaction d(25Al,n)26Si              C167400100044
