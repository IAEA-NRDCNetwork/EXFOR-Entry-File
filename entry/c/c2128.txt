SAMPLE     Liquid Hydrogen Target. The liquid hydrogen was        C212800100018 
           contained in a 30-mm-thick cylindrical aluminum target C212800100019 
           cell with 125 mu-m Kapton entrance and exit windows.   C212800100020 
           The cell was surrounded by a 1-mm-thick aluminum       C212800100021 
           radiation shield with entrance and exit windows        C212800100022 
           covered by 5 mu-m aluminized Mylar foil. The           C212800100023 
           temperature and pressure of the target cell were       C212800100024 
           maintained at 16.0 K and 868 Torr throughout the       C212800100025 
           experiment.The liquefied gas in target cell placed at  C212800100026 
           the center of a gamma-ray detector array.              C212800100027 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The GRETINA gamma-ray tracking array was used   C212800100028 
           for gamma ray measurement. The array, consisting of 28 C212800100029 
           36-fold segmented high-purity germanium crystals       C212800100030 
           packaged in seven clusters of four crystals each, was  C212800100031 
           installed at the pivot point of the S800 in a          C212800100032 
           configuration designed to accommodate the liquid       C212800100033 
           hydrogen target. Two of the seven modules were mounted C212800100034 
           at 58deg, four at 90deg, and one at 122deg with        C212800100035 
           respect to the beam axis.                              C212800100036

INC-SOURCE A cocktail beam was produced by the fragmentation of a C212800100038 
           130-MeV/u 76Ge primary beam in a 376-mg/cm2 9Be        C212800100039 
           production target. The secondary products were         C212800100040 
           separated by the A1900 fragment separator. A 45-mg/cm2 C212800100041 
           aluminum achromatic wedge was used to enhance          C212800100042 
           separation of the cocktail by Z. A total of 4.3E+8     C212800100043 
           secondary beam particles traversed the reaction target C212800100044 
           in 114 h. Of these, 3.0E+7 particles were tagged as    C212800100045 
           50Ca particles in both incoming and outgoing particle  C212800100046 
           identification gates, and 4.0E+6 particles were tagged C212800100047 
           as 48Ca, corresponding to 73 particles per second and  C212800100048 
           9.3 particles per second, respectively.                C212800100049

CORRECTION Correction for Doppler shift of gamma rays energies wasC212800100051 
           made. The corresponding beam velocities, v/c = 0.43 andC212800100052 
           v/c = 0.41 were used for 48Ca and 50Ca, respectively.  C212800100053
