SAMPLE     Al2O3 target enriched in 18O (>90% of 18O) were        C191700100009

DETECTOR   (SIBAR)                                                C191700100012 
PART-DET   (A,P)                                                  C191700100013 
METHOD     (ASPEC) Five silicon surface-barrier detectors were    C191700100014 
           used in the measurement. A detector at theta=157       C191700100015 
           degrees was used to monitor the incident beam          C191700100016 
           energies and for normalizing O-18(n,alpha)N-15         C191700100017 
           yields. The other detectors were mounted on a movable  C191700100018 
           plate, and subtended a solid angle of approximately    C191700100019 
           11.1 msr. In the energy range of 550 keV < Ep< 235     C191700100020 
           keV, a 3.05 micrometer thick Ni foil was placed in     C191700100021 
           front of each of the four movable counters to stop     C191700100022 
           the elastically scattered protons. At low proton       C191700100023 
           energies, charge collection after transmission         C191700100024 
           through the target foils was found to be unreliable,   C191700100025 
           probably due to scattering and charge exchange. Hence  C191700100026 
           the absolute cross sections were deduced from the      C191700100027 
           W(p,p)W elastic cross sections which were assumed to   C191700100028 
           be pure Rutherford. The solid angles of the movable    C191700100029 
           detectors relative to that of the monitor detector     C191700100030 
           were measured by means of the W(p,p)W reaction at 2    C191700100031 
           MeV, by placing the detectors, one at a time, at the   C191700100032 
           same backward angle as the monitor detector. The       C191700100033 
           results agreed with geometrically estimated values.    C191700100034 
           Only the measured relative solid angle values          C191700100035 
           were used in calculating cross sections.               C191700100036 
ANALYSIS   The data were analyzed using the R-matrix theory.      C191700100037 
           Since the entrance and exit channels have spin and     C191700100038 
           parity 1/2+ and 1/2-, respectively, for a resonance    C191700100039 
           with well-defined spin and parity Jpi, only one        C191700100040 
           l-value is allowed for each channel. The values for    C191700100041 
           the boundary conditions and the interaction radii are  C191700100042 
           arbitrary insofar as small changes in their values     C191700100043 
           can be compensated for by appropriate changes in the   C191700100044 
           level parameters without affecting the calculated      C191700100045 
           cross sections. The data were fitted with sums of      C191700100046 
           Legendre polynomials and the total cross sections      C191700100047 
           were obtained. In fitting the total cross section,     C191700100048 
           the contribution from the resonance at E(cm)=314.5     C191700100049 
           keV was neglected. The level parameters for the 1/2+   C191700100050 
           resonance at Ep=846 keV and the 3/2- resonance at      C191700100051 
           Ep=629.5 keV have been determined very accurately by   C191700100052 
           Yagi et al. and the reported values were used in the   C191700100053 
           calculation. In addition a broad 1/2+ resonance at     C191700100054 
           650 keV and a broad 1/2- resonance at 750 keV were     C191700100055 
           introduced. The parameters of these two resonances     C191700100056 
           were adjusted to fit the O-18(p,alpha)N-15 cross       C191700100057 
           section as well as previously published data.          C191700100058
