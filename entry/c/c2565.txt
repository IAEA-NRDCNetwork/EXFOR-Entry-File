INC-SPECT  The integrated beam fluence was 1.49x10**18 ions       C2565  1   23 
           delivered over a period of 41 days. (58% of this time  C2565  1   24 
           was spent taking data for the 59Co+209Bi reaction.)    C2565  1   25 
SAMPLE     Each set of nine 1.4x9 cm sector targets, nominally    C2565  1   26 
           500 microg/cm2 Bi metal evaporated onto 150-300        C2565  1   27 
           microg/cm2 Al substrates, was mounted on a 30-cm       C2565  1   28 
           diameter swiftly rotating wheel.                       C2565  1   29 
DETECTOR   (SISD) The focal plane detector system was a linear    C2565  1   30 
           array of five adjacent Si wafers, with each wafer      C2565  1   31 
           having ten detector strips on it that were 3-mm wide   C2565  1   32 
           and 28-mm high. Each detector strip was                C2565  1   33 
           position-sensitive in the 28-mm direction. The         C2565  1   34 
           depletion depth of the detectors was 100 microm and    C2565  1   35 
           the average implantation depth of a compound nucleus   C2565  1   36 
           recoil was 8 microm.                                   C2565  1   37 
METHOD     (ASPEC,EDE,REC) The beam entered the separator         C2565  1   38 
           through a thin window (50-250 microg/cm2 of C or C-A1- C2565  1   39 
           C). The beam then struck the 0.5 mg/cm2 Bi metal       C2565  1   40 
           targets which were mounted on a rapidly rotating       C2565  1   41 
           target wheel to dissipate the energy deposited by the  C2565  1   42 
           beam. The signals from the dE/dx detector (which was   C2565  1   43 
           in front of the focal plane array) were used to        C2565  1   44 
           identify recoil implantation and fission events, and   C2565  1   45 
           by their absence, alpha-particle events.               C2565  1   46
