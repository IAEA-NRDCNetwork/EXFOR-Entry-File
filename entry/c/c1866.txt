SAMPLE     Liquid helium target with length of 15 cm              C186600100008 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Protons were detected with three plastic        C186600100009 
           scintillation counters. Two plastic scintillation      C186600100010 
           detectors with diameter of 0.7cm defined the incident  C186600100011 
           proton beam. Third plastic counter with diameter of    C186600100012 
           15 cm, located 73 cm behind the target was used to     C186600100013 
           detect scattered protons.                              C186600100014 
METHOD     (TRN) Transmission method was used                     C186600100015 
CORRECTION Following correction were made                         C186600100016
