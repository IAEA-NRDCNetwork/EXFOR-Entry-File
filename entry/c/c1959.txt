FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Measurements were conducted at the     C195900100010 
           ISAC facility at TRIUMF, using DRAGON recoil separator C195900100011 
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target was filled with 4He maintained   C195900100012 
           at a central pressure of 7.7 Torr, the effective       C195900100013 
           target length was 12.3+-5 cm                           C195900100014 
DETECTOR   (SPEC) 20Ne ions produced in the reaction were         C195900100015 
           detected after separation from the beam using a        C195900100016 
           two-stage electromagnetic separator with an angular    C195900100017 
           acceptance of 21 mrad for reactions at the center of   C195900100018 
           the target. The separator was tuned in such a way, thatC195900100019 
           only the 4+ charge state was transmitted               C195900100020 
           (IOCH) An ionization chamber placed in the focal       C195900100021 
           plane of the electromagnetic separator was used to     C195900100022 
           detect 20Ne recoils from the reaction.                 C195900100023 
           (MCPLT) Two microchannel plates upstream of the        C195900100024 
           ionization chamber were used to measure the            C195900100025 
           time-of-flight across the 59 cm distance between       C195900100026 
           them. The transmission through the microchannel        C195900100027 
           plates setup was 85+-5%.                               C195900100028 
           (BGO) An array of 30 bismuth germanate gamma-ray       C195900100029 
           detectors in a tight geometry was used to detect       C195900100030 
           capture gamma rays                                     C195900100031 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between recoiling 20Ne ions and    C195900100032 
           gamma rays was used to reduce background               C195900100033 
           (TOF) Time of flight was used to identify the          C195900100034 
           recoiling nuclei.                                      C195900100035 
           Inverse kinematics was used.                           C195900100036 
INC-SOURCE The Supernanogan off-line ion source was used to       C195900100037 
           produce 16O beam.                                      C195900100038 
CORRECTION Correction for transmission of 4+ charge state was     C195900100039 
           made. Distribution of charge states of neon after      C195900100040 
           passing through helium was measured for this purpose.  C195900100041 
           20Ne beam was also produced in Supernanogun            C195900100042
