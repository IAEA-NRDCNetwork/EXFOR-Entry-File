           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using       C196900100011 
           A1200 fragment separator.                              C196900100012 
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes  C196900100013 
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and      C196900100014 
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists    C196900100015 
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric    C196900100016 
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)       C196900100017 
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three        C196900100018 
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,       C196900100019 
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,            C196900100020 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C196900100021 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C196900100022 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C196900100023 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C196900100024 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C196900100025 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C196900100026 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C196900100027 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C196900100028 
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a      C196900100029 
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.      C196900100030 
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin      C196900100031 
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator      C196900100032 
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed   C196900100033 
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI              C196900100034 
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by      C196900100035 
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling  C196900100036 
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage      C196900100037 
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.    C196900100038
