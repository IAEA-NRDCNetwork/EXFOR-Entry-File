           Experiments were done with stack of foils and with     C122500100013 
           single foil, sandwiched between two aluminum catcher   C122500100014 
SAMPLE     The tantalum, tungsten, and gold foils (>99.9% purity) C122500100015 
           were  nominally 3 mu-m in thickness so that proton     C122500100016 
           energy loss through  a foil was negligible.            C122500100017 
           Aluminum activation foils (10 mu-m thickness,          C122500100018 
           99.0% purity) were used for beam  monitoring           C122500100019 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) Monitor cross-sections were used to determine   C122500100020 
           the proton fluence by counting the 22Na with a HPGe    C122500100021 
           detector calibrated with a 152Eu source.               C122500100022 
            The gamma-spectroscopy system was used not only for   C122500100023 
           measuring 22Na, but also for measuring other           C122500100024
