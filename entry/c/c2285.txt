ANALYSIS   Reconstruction of the velocity vectors of the          C2285  2   21

           the capture excitation function because straight-      C2285  2   25 
           forward calculations for these reactions indicate      C2285  2   26 
           that 99% of the capture events undergo fission.        C2285  2   27
