INC-SOURCE Two separate experiments were  performed at the Los    C2241  1   11 
           Alamos Neutron Science Center at LANL using incident   C2241  1   12 
           proton energies of 100 and 200MeV. In each experiment, C2241  1   13 
           the original beam energy was degraded to approximately C2241  1   14 
           half of its original value using aluminum degraders.   C2241  1   15 
SAMPLE     Natural thorium foils of 99.7% purity were used in     C2241  1   16 
           the experiment. The foils were of 2.5mm x 2.5mm        C2241  1   17 
           approximate dimensions, with mass thicknesses ranging  C2241  1   18 
           from 60.5 to 70.5 g/cm2.                               C2241  1   19 
MONITOR    (13-AL-27(P,X)11-NA-22,,SIG) Aluminum foils of 99.9%   C2241  1   20

DETECTOR   (HPGE) Thorium foils irradiated for nuclear reaction   C2241  1   23 
           cross section measurements were counted on an ORTEC    C2241  1   24 
           GEM10P4-70 p-type Al-windowed detector with relative   C2241  1   25 
           efficiency of 10% at 1333 keV and a measured FWHM of   C2241  1   26 
           1.99 keV at 1333 keV                                   C2241  1   27 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used. Irradiated foils   C2241  1   28 
           were counted over a period of approximately 12 months, C2241  1   29 
           collecting approximately 300 spectra                   C2241  1   30 
           (CHSEP) A sequence of chromatographic separations was  C2241  1   31 
           developed to isolate Pa isotopes from the irradiated   C2241  1   32 
           Th target and subsequently remove fission and other    C2241  1   33 
           activation products. In the first step, Pa was         C2241  1   34 
           isolated from the bulk Th mass via anion exchange in   C2241  1   35 
           hydrochloric acid media. In the second step sample     C2241  1   36 
           was divided in two similarly sized target portions     C2241  1   37 
           were dissolved and two slightly different methods of   C2241  1   38 
           anion exchange were performed with each portion.       C2241  1   39 
           After the anion exchange step, the respective Pa       C2241  1   40 
           fractions were collected and subjected to extraction   C2241  1   41 
           chromatography.                                        C2241  1   42
