SAMPLE     (82-PB-208,ENR=0.95) Two isotopically enriched 208Pb   C2627  1   17 
           foils with thickness of 2.37 mg/cm2, evaporated on a   C2627  1   18 
           0.08 mg/cm2 thick carbon backing                       C2627  1   19 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) Charged particles were detected      C2627  1   20 
           using telescope consisting of two double-sided         C2627  1   21 
           silicon strip detectors (DSSSD) was placed at forward  C2627  1   22 
           angle. E detectcor was 128 x 128 DSSSD with active     C2627  1   23 
           area of 97.2 x 97.2 mm2 and thickness of 500 mu-m. dE  C2627  1   24 
           detector was 16 x 16 DSSSD with active area of 49.5 x  C2627  1   25 
           49.5 mm2 and thickness of 38 mu-m. E and dE detectors  C2627  1   26 
           were placed 100 mm and 50 mm away from target,         C2627  1   27 
           respectivelly and covered laboratory theta angles      C2627  1   28 
           between 15 deg and 89 deg.                             C2627  1   29 
           (SISD) Another identical DSSSD E detector was placed   C2627  1   30 
           at a distance 100 mm from the target at backward       C2627  1   31 
           angle, covering theta laboratoty angles between 87     C2627  1   32 
           deg and 161 deg.                                       C2627  1   33

INC-SOURCE The radioactive 10C beam was produced by the charge-   C2627  1   35 
           exchange p(10B,10C)n reaction. The primary 10B beam    C2627  1   36 
           with energy of 9.6MeV/u was delivered by the K500      C2627  1   37 
           superconducting cyclotron and impinged on a cooled H2  C2627  1   38 
           gas cell. The produced 10C ions were selected by the   C2627  1   39 
           Momentum Achromatic Recoil Spectrometer.               C2627  1   40
