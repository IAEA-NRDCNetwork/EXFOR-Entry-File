DETECTOR   (PROPC) Gamma-ray activities from the Na24 generated   C2836001   10 
           in the individual foils were measured on a calibrated  C2836001   11 
           platinum screen wall counter shielded with 1/16" lead, C2836001   12 
           and compared with a 10-microgram radium standard to    C2836001   13 
           obtain the absolute disintegration rates. Decays of    C2836001   14 
           several foils were also followed for a few days as a   C2836001   15 
           check on the identity of the activity. The Na22        C2836001   16 
           positrons in the foils were measured with a bell-type  C2836001   17 
           thin window counter after the shorter-lived component  C2836001   18 
           had died away.                                         C2836001   19 
SAMPLE     The magnesium disks, because of their fragility, were  C2836001   20 
           sealed between layers of aluminum foil (0.00025") and  C2836001   21 
           stacked, resulting in a series of 24 absorbers whose   C2836001   22 
           average individual thickness was 7.7 mg/cm2 and whose  C2836001   23 
           total thickness, 185 mg/cm2, was approximately equal toC2836001   24 
            the distance of penetration of the 14-MeV deuterons   C2836001   25 
           used.                                                  C2836001   26 
METHOD     (CHSEP,STTA,ACTIV) The stack of foils was bombarded    C2836001   27 
           for 1.5 hours, 47.5-microampere minutes, with a        C2836001   28 
           deuteron beam whose initial energy was 14.20 MeV       C2836001   29 
            (range 184.5 mg/cm2 Al). After bombardment the        C2836001   30 
           targets should be allowed to age for about a week to   C2836001   31 
           allow the Na24 to decay, thus reducing the radiation   C2836001   32 
           hazard. The aged target is weighed and dissolved in    C2836001   33 
           50 percent excess of glacial acetic acid. With the     C2836001   34 
           metal the reaction is slow in starting but becomes     C2836001   35 
           very vigorous as it proceeds. After the reaction       C2836001   36 
           subsides, the solution is diluted with an equal        C2836001   37 
           volume of 50 percent alcohol. The last traces of       C2836001   38 
           metal are dissolved after 15-30 minutes. If any        C2836001   39 
           insoluble residue remains, it is removed by filtration.C2836001   40 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) Even though individual thicknesses             C2836001   41 
           varied as much as 20 percent, the data could be        C2836001   42 
           corrected for these variations to reduce errors from   C2836001   43 
           this source to about 2 percent.                        C2836001   44
