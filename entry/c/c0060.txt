CORRECTION A guard foil was placed in contact with the foil to    C0060  1   18 
           be counted. The guard served as a source of recoil     C0060  1   19 
           carbon-11 nuclei, compensating for recoils lost        C0060  1   20 
           through the back of the counted foil. The              C0060  1   21 
           self-absorption in the foil was investigated and the   C0060  1   22 
           correction was found to be less than 1% up to 4mg/cm2, C0060  1   23 
           then increasing by about 0.8% per mg/cm2.              C0060  1   24
