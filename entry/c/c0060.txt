SAMPLE     Thin polyethylene foils, 4 mg/cm2.                     C006000100008

DETECTOR   (PROPC) 4pi proportional counter continuously flushed  C006000100011 
            with methane at atmospheric pressure.  The counter    C006000100012 
            was standardized with P32 or Na24 sources.            C006000100013

CORRECTION A guard foil was placed in contact with the foil to be C006000100015 
             counted.  The guard served as a source of recoil     C006000100016 
             carbon-11 nuclei, compensating for recoils lost      C006000100017 
             through the back of the counted foil.                C006000100018 
           The self-absorption in the foil was investigated and   C006000100019 
             the correction was found to be less than 1% up to    C006000100020 
             4mg/cm2, then increasing by about 0.8% per mg/cm2.   C006000100021
