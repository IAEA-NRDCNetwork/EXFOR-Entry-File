METHOD     In order to determine the ratio of the number of       C2844001   12 
           gamma-rays to the number of neutrons from the          C2844001   13 
           reaction, the target holder was placed directly        C2844001   14 
           within the cloud chamber and surrounded by a foil of   C2844001   15 
           Cellophane 0.1 mm thick. From the number of proton     C2844001   16 
           tracks coming from this foil the neutron intensity     C2844001   17 
           could be estimated using the known cross section for   C2844001   18 
           neutron-proton scattering. The gamma-ray intensity     C2844001   19 
           was determined simultaneously by counting the Compton  C2844001   20 
           electrons produced in a sheet of carbon in the center  C2844001   21 
           of the chamber. From the ratio of Compton electrons    C2844001   22 
           to protons obtained in this way it was calculated      C2844001   23 
           that there is not more than one gamma-ray for every    C2844001   24 
           200 neutrons.                                          C2844001   25

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: The energy of                      C2844003    4 
           "greater than 15 MeV" was actually detected for        C2844003    5 
           protons. Authors argue that they must be due to        C2844003    6 
           neutrons, "possibly" from the T(d,n) He-4 reaction.    C2844003    7 
           In fact, it is a first observation of 14 MeV neutrons  C2844003    8 
           for D-D reactions.                                     C2844003    9
