FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the    C2215  1   16 
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, MichiganC2215  1   17 
           State University.                                      C2215  1   18 
SAMPLE     Sample was a deuterated polyethylene target (CD2)n     C2215  1   19 
           with thickness of (10.7+-0.8)mg/cm2                    C2215  1   20 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Recoil products were identified with the S800  C2215  1   21 
           spectrograph downstream of the GRETINA array. The      C2215  1   22 
           S800 was run in focused mode in order to allow a       C2215  1   23 
           large momentum acceptance. The data acquisition was    C2215  1   24 
           triggered either by recoil-gamma coincidences between  C2215  1   25 
           GRETINA and the first scintillator at the focal plane  C2215  1   26 
           of the S800 spectrograph                               C2215  1   27 
           (HPGE) Gamma rays were measured using GRETINA (Gamma-  C2215  1   28 
           Ray Energy Tracking Inbeam Nuclear Array). GRETINA     C2215  1   29 
           detectors positioned at laboratory angles of 58 deg    C2215  1   30 
           and 90 deg.                                            C2215  1   31 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence of recoil products detected in     C2215  1   32 
           S800 focal plane scintillator and gamma rays detected  C2215  1   33 
           in GRETINA detectors was required. Inverse kinematics  C2215  1   34 
           was used.                                              C2215  1   35 
INC-SOURCE The 30MeV/u 26Al13+ beam was produced inflight via     C2215  1   36 
           fragmentation reactions using a primary beam of        C2215  1   37 
           150MeV/u, 112 pnA 36Ar18+ ions to bombard a            C2215  1   38 
           1960mg/cm2 thick Be target. The A1900 high-resolution  C2215  1   39 
           fragment separator selected the ions of interest       C2215  1   40 
           based on the momentum/charge, p/q, ratio after they    C2215  1   41 
           had passed through a 600mg/cm2 thick Al wedge The      C2215  1   42 
           26Al beam had a high purity (98+-2)% and an average    C2215  1   43
