DETECTOR   (HPGE) The radioactivities of the product              C3051001   13 
           radionuclides were measured non-destructively using a  C3051001   14 
           high-purity germanium gamma-ray detector.              C3051001   15 
SAMPLE     Fe foils of 25 microm thickness (supplied by           C3051001   16 
           Goodfellow; chemical purity: 99.0 %) were used as      C3051001   17 
           target.                                                C3051001   18 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The activity measurement for each sample was   C3051001   19 
           repeated by giving sufficient decay interval to check  C3051001   20 
           the half-lives of the activation products as well as   C3051001   21 
           to avoid interferences by overlapping gamma-lines      C3051001   22 
           from undesired products. At 5 cm counting distance,    C3051001   23 
           the effect of the sample size on the efficiency and    C3051001   24 
           also the random coincidence loss became almost         C3051001   25 
           negligible.                                            C3051001   26 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The peak area (counts) under a characteristic  C3051001   27 
           gamma-ray of a reaction product was converted to       C3051001   28 
           count rate and then converted to the decay rate by     C3051001   29 
           applying corrections for gamma-ray intensity and       C3051001   30 
           efficiency of the detector. The decay rate was         C3051001   31 
           extrapolated to the end of bombardment (EOB). From     C3051001   32 
           the decay rate at EOB and the measured deuteron beam   C3051001   33 
           flux, the cross section for the formation of the       C3051001   34 
           radioactive product was calculated using the           C3051001   35 
           well-known activation equations.                       C3051001   36 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The combined uncertainty in the cross section  C3051001   37 
           was estimated from the uncertainties associated with   C3051001   38 
           measurements: peak area (0.5-7 %), efficiency of the   C3051001   39 
           detector (4 %), gamma-ray intensities (0.006-1.4 %),   C3051001   40 
           half-life (0.0001-0.05 %) and deuteron flux (6 %).     C3051001   41 
           The overall uncertainty of measured cross sections     C3051001   42 
           amounted to 8-12 % (1 sigma).                          C3051001   43

CORRECTION The correction for the true coincident gamma-ray       C3051001   49 
           summing was also negligible.                           C3051001   50
