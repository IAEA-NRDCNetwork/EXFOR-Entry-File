DETECTOR   (SCIN) After bombardment, the naton-136 target was     C005600100015 
            placed between two other naton-136 discs, 6-mm thick. C005600100016 
            The three scintillators were coupled to a 56avp       C005600100017 
            photomultiplier and enclosed in an aluminum can.      C005600100018

            Authors assumed target to be pure carbon-12 for       C005600200004 
            purposes of calculations.                             C005600200005 
ANALYSIS   Measurements were taken for six separate 5-minute      C005600200006 
            intervals after the bombardment.  From these six      C005600200007 
            measurements, three values of the cross section were  C005600200008 
            calculated for each bombardment.                      C005600200009 
           Seventeen measurements were made using different beam  C005600200010 
            intensities and target thicknesses.  All measurements C005600200011 
            were consistent to within the statistical uncertainty C005600200012 
            of 1%.                                                C005600200013
