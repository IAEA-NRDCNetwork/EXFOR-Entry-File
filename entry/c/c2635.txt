FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The Chicago synchrocyclotron.          C2635  1   10 
INC-SOURCE The pions are produced by a 450-MeV proton beam        C2635  1   11 
           striking a beryllium target inside the cyclotron.      C2635  1   12 
           Negative pions emitted in the forward direction are    C2635  1   13 
           bent outward by the cyclotron magnetic field and       C2635  1   14 
           emerge through a thin aluminum window from the vacuum  C2635  1   15 
           chamber of the machine. Positive pions are obtained    C2635  1   16 
           by reversing the direction of both the cyclotron and   C2635  1   17 
           the deflecting magnetic fields.                        C2635  1   18 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Liquid scintillation counters: The cell is      C2635  1   19 
           made of clear Lucite 4-in. thick over all with         C2635  1   20 
           1/16-in. thick Lucite windows. The liquid is           C2635  1   21 
           phenyl cyclohexane with 3 grams per liter of terphenyl C2635  1   22 
           and 10 mg per liter of diphenyl hexatriene according   C2635  1   23 
           to the prescription of Kallman. The end of the         C2635  1   24 
           Lucite cell is shaped to fit the photocathode of a     C2635  1   25 
           5819 tube and good optical contact is assured by a     C2635  1   26 
           thin layer of clear silicone grease.                   C2635  1   27

METHOD     (COINC) The pion beam is defined by passing through    C2635  2    4 
           two 2-in. diameter liquid scintillation counters, and  C2635  2    5 
           thereafter enters the hydrogen cell. The scattered     C2635  2    6 
           particles are detected by a pair of scintillation      C2635  2    7 
           counters, arranged on a table to pivot around the      C2635  2    8 
           central axis of the hydrogen cell. A quadruple         C2635  2    9 
           coincidence is recorded when a particle passes         C2635  2   10 
           through the first two counters and is scattered so as  C2635  2   11 
           to pass through the second pair. The double            C2635  2   12 
           coincidences of the first pair are recorded at the     C2635  2   13 
           same time. The fraction of the incident beam which is  C2635  2   14 
           scattered is given by the ratio of the quadruple to    C2635  2   15 
           double coincidences. The hydrogen cell was designed    C2635  2   16 
           for rapid insertion and removal of the liquid          C2635  2   17 
           hydrogen in order to distinguish the effect of the     C2635  2   18 
           hydrogen from the scattering by surrounding            C2635  2   19 
           materials. The mean path length of pions traversing    C2635  2   20 
           the hydrogen in these experiments was 14.4 cm. When    C2635  2   21 
           the cell was filled with liquid hydrogen, the number   C2635  2   22 
           of atoms/cm2 was 4.2*10**22. When the cell was empty,  C2635  2   23 
           it is  still contained gaseous hydrogen at liquid      C2635  2   24 
           hydrogen temperature amounting to 0.07*10**22          C2635  2   25 
           atoms/cm2. The difference, 4.13*10**22, multiplied by  C2635  2   26 
           the effective length of the scattering cell, gives     C2635  2   27 
           5.95*10**23 H atoms/cm2. The efficiency of counters    C2635  2   28 
           No. 3 and No. 4 for counting a scattered pion that     C2635  2   29 
           geometrically should be accepted by both counters was  C2635  2   30 
           not 100 percent because the counter efficiency was     C2635  2   31 
           not perfect (98 percent), and nuclear absorption in    C2635  2   32 
           the first counter and in the hydrogen cell further     C2635  2   33 
           reduced the efficiency to about 93 percent.            C2635  2   34 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The probable errors are those due to           C2635  2   35 
           statistics alone. Uncertainties in the beam energy     C2635  2   36 
           and its pion content as well as in the estimates of    C2635  2   37 
           the efficiency of detection all contribute to the      C2635  2   38 
           inaccuracy of the experiment. These additional errors  C2635  2   39 
           have not been added in this case because the           C2635  2   40 
           statistical error was believed to be dominant.         C2635  2   41

METHOD     (COINC) The pion beam is defined by passing through    C2635  4    4 
           two 2-in. diameter liquid scintillation counters, and  C2635  4    5 
           thereafter enters the hydrogen cell. The scattered     C2635  4    6 
           particles are detected by a pair of scintillation      C2635  4    7 
           counters, arranged on a table to pivot around the      C2635  4    8 
           central axis of the hydrogen cell. A quadruple         C2635  4    9 
           coincidence is recorded when a particle passes         C2635  4   10 
           through the first two counters and is scattered so as  C2635  4   11 
           to pass through the second pair. The double            C2635  4   12 
           coincidences of the first pair are recorded at the     C2635  4   13 
           same time. The fraction of the incident beam which is  C2635  4   14 
           scattered is given by the ratio of the quadruple to    C2635  4   15 
           double coincidences. The hydrogen cell was designed    C2635  4   16 
           for rapid insertion and removal of the liquid          C2635  4   17 
           hydrogen in order to distinguish the effect of the     C2635  4   18 
           hydrogen from the scattering by surrounding            C2635  4   19 
           materials. The mean path length of pions traversing    C2635  4   20 
           the hydrogen in these experiments was 14.4 cm. When    C2635  4   21 
           the cell was filled with liquid hydrogen, the number   C2635  4   22 
           of atoms/cm2 was 4.2*10**22. When the cell was empty,  C2635  4   23 
           it is  still contained gaseous hydrogen at liquid      C2635  4   24 
           hydrogen temperature amounting to 0.07*10**22          C2635  4   25 
           atoms/cm2. The difference, 4.13*10**22, multiplied by  C2635  4   26 
           the effective length of the scattering cell, gives     C2635  4   27 
           5.95*10**23 H atoms/cm2. The efficiency of counters    C2635  4   28 
           No. 3 and No. 4 for counting a scattered pion that     C2635  4   29 
           geometrically should be accepted by both counters was  C2635  4   30 
           not 100 percent because the counter efficiency was     C2635  4   31 
           not perfect (98 percent), and nuclear absorption in    C2635  4   32 
           the first counter and in the hydrogen cell further     C2635  4   33 
           reduced the efficiency to about 93 percent.            C2635  4   34 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors indicated in these two cross     C2635  4   35 
           sections comprise only the statistical error. Other    C2635  4   36 
           sources of error are, in order of importance, the      C2635  4   37 
           uncertainty in the efficiencies in the actual pion     C2635  4   38 
           content and energy of the beam, and geometrical        C2635  4   39 
           errors. We have estimated that the overall effect of   C2635  4   40 
           these errors may amount to 10 percent, and this error  C2635  4   41 
           has been combined with the statistical error in the    C2635  4   42 
           fina1 results.                                         C2635  4   43

CORRECTION A very small correction has been included on account   C2635  4   45 
           of the contribution of the inverse photoeffect.        C2635  4   46
