FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the 88-inch    C2685  1   10 
           cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory C2685  1   11 
SAMPLE     The beam was incident on a 4"-diameter target wheel    C2685  1   12 
           rotating at approx. 30 Hz, located upstream of the BGS.C2685  1   13 
           The target wheel contained four target segments - threeC2685  1   14 
           segments of 209Bi with an average thickness of         C2685  1   15 
           0.500 mg/cm2 for  the production of Md isotopes and    C2685  1   16 
           a fourth segment  made of 165Ho with an average        C2685  1   17 
           thickness of 0.365 mg/cm2 for the production of At     C2685  1   18 
           isotopes.                                              C2685  1   19 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,SISD) Reaction products recoiled to the         C2685  1   20 
           Berkeley Gas-filled Separator, where they were         C2685  1   21 
           separated according to ions A/q. At the BGS focal      C2685  1   22 
           plane ions can be implanted into a retractable 32 x    C2685  1   23 
           32 double-sided silicon strip detector or ions could   C2685  1   24 
           pass through 2.1 mu-m thick Ti foil into FIONA setup.  C2685  1   25 
           (SISD) After magnetic analysis in BGS, the beam        C2685  1   26 
           entered the FIONA setup, which consisted of beam       C2685  1   27 
           manipulation elements as RFQ cooler and trap,          C2685  1   28 
           accelerating element with focusing, steering and       C2685  1   29 
           diagnostic. The accelerated beam entered               C2685  1   30 
           low-background area where the ions were separated by   C2685  1   31 
           their A/q in a trochoidal spectrometer which utilizes  C2685  1   32 
           crossed magnetic and electric fields, tuned to force   C2685  1   33 
           the ions traveling through the spectrometer to take    C2685  1   34 
           trochoidal trajectories. At the FIONA focal plane      C2685  1   35 
           ions are implanted into 32 x 32 strip double sided Si  C2685  1   36 
           strip detector.                                        C2685  1   37 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Evaporation residue (EVR)-alpha-alpha          C2685  1   38 
           correlations were searched for in data taken at the    C2685  1   39 
           220 MeV beam energy with the BGS focal plane detector  C2685  1   40 
           inserted and FIONE focal plane detector. Time windows  C2685  1   41 
           were expanded up to 30 and 300 s for EVR-alpha1 and    C2685  1   42 
           EVR-alpha1-alpha2, respectively. The 244Md was         C2685  1   43 
           identified according to EVR mass and energies of       C2685  1   44 
           series of decay alphas.                                C2685  1   45
