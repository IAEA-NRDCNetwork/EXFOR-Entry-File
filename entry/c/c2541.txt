METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC,XSPEC) Immediately following the          C2541  1   13 
           irradiation, the catcher foil was dissolved in hot 8M  C2541  1   14 
           HNO, in the presence of Hg+2. The berkelium products   C2541  1   15 
           were oxidized to +4 using CrO, and were extracted      C2541  1   16 
           into bis (2-ethylhexyl) orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP)   C2541  1   17

           1-inch diameter platinum disks for x-ray, gamma,       C2541  1   19 
           and/or alpha counting. The time from the end of the    C2541  1   20

SAMPLE     The thorium isotopes were present in natural           C2541  6    4 
           abundance. The targets were prepared by                C2541  6    5 
           electrospraying the nitrates dissolved in acetone      C2541  6    6 
           onto 1-mil thick beryllium backing foils kept at       C2541  6    7 
           250C. The 0.5-cm2 area targets were heated to red      C2541  6    8 
           heat in an induction furnace to ensure conversion of   C2541  6    9 
           the target material to the oxides. The typical target  C2541  6   10 
           thickness was 400 microg/cm2.                          C2541  6   11 
METHOD     (CHSEP) Curium and americium were chemically           C2541  6   12 
           separated from the catcher foil and the final          C2541  6   13 
           chemical fraction was analyzed for the emission of     C2541  6   14 
           both gamma rays and alpha particles.                   C2541  6   15
