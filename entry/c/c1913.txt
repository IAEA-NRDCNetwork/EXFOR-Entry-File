METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,STTA) All target were activated in the    C191300100019 
           internal proton beams of LBL. The target stacks as     C191300100020 
           traversed by the proton beam consisted of a 0.005 cm   C191300100021 
           aluminum foil, three separate 0.0008 cm aluminum       C191300100022 
           foils, the enriched target layer on the thin aluminum  C191300100023 
           backings and a final 0.005 cm aluminum foil. The       C191300100024 
           desired product nuclei were assayed by gamma counting  C191300100025 
           the target and monitor foils with Ge(Li) detector.     C191300100026 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) All photopeaks were analyzed by the computer   C191300100027 
           code SAMPO. The resulting decay curves were analyzed   C191300100028 
           by the standard least squares program CLSQ.            C191300100029
