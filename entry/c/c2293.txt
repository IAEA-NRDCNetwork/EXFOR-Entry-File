DETECTOR   (NAICR) NaI(Tl) crystal.                               C229300100010 
SAMPLE     Stacks of 4-mil polyethylene foils.                    C229300100011 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The experiment was performed by           C229300100012 
           bombarding polyethylene foils with about 1/100         C229300100013 
           microampere of 20-MeV deuterons for periods of the     C229300100014 
           order of 30 minutes, during which time the beam        C229300100015 
           current was held constant to better than 10%. After    C229300100016 
           the bombardment the individual foils were trapped      C229300100017 
           between aluminum sheets of thickness adequate to       C229300100018 
           absorb the positrons of N13 and C11, and the decay     C229300100019 
           was followed over many half-lives by counting the      C229300100020 
           annihilation quanta with an NaI(Tl) crystal. (Neither  C229300100021 
           body gives nuclear gamma rays.)                        C229300100022 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) All decay curves were analyzed to find the     C229300100023 
           relative amounts of N13 and C11 present in each foil   C229300100024 
           at the end of the irradiations. The surface densities  C229300100025 
           of the polyethylene foils were determined by weighing  C229300100026 
           small triangles cut from the bombarded region of each  C229300100027 
           foil; they were constant to within 2 percent from      C229300100028 
           foil to foil and no correction was necessary on        C229300100029 
           account of variations in surface density. With these   C229300100030 
           data, relative cross sections for the (d,n) and (d,t)  C229300100031 
           reactions were computed.                               C229300100032 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,,50.) The absolute cross section scale,      C229300100033 
           however, was not set up with great care and may be in  C229300100034 
           error by as much as 50 percent.                        C229300100035 
CORRECTION The relative amounts of N13 and C11 were corrected     C229300100036 
           for the finite duration of the bombardments.           C229300100037
