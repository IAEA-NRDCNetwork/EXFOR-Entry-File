SAMPLE     Stacks of 4-mil polyethylene foils.                    C2293  1   11 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA) The experiment was performed by           C2293  1   12 
           bombarding polyethylene foils with about 1/100         C2293  1   13 
           microampere of 20-MeV deuterons for periods of the     C2293  1   14 
           order of 30 minutes, during which time the beam        C2293  1   15 
           current was held constant to better than 10%. After    C2293  1   16 
           the bombardment the individual foils were trapped      C2293  1   17 
           between aluminum sheets of thickness adequate to       C2293  1   18 
           absorb the positrons of N13 and C11, and the decay     C2293  1   19 
           was followed over many half-lives by counting the      C2293  1   20 
           annihilation quanta with an NaI(Tl) crystal. (Neither  C2293  1   21 
           body gives nuclear gamma rays.)                        C2293  1   22 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) All decay curves were analyzed to find the     C2293  1   23 
           relative amounts of N13 and C11 present in each foil   C2293  1   24 
           at the end of the irradiations. The surface densities  C2293  1   25 
           of the polyethylene foils were determined by weighing  C2293  1   26 
           small triangles cut from the bombarded region of each  C2293  1   27 
           foil; they were constant to within 2 percent from      C2293  1   28 
           foil to foil and no correction was necessary on        C2293  1   29 
           account of variations in surface density. With these   C2293  1   30 
           data, relative cross sections for the (d,n) and (d,t)  C2293  1   31 
           reactions were computed.                               C2293  1   32 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,,50.) The absolute cross section scale,      C2293  1   33 
           however, was not set up with great care and may be in  C2293  1   34 
           error by as much as 50 percent.                        C2293  1   35 
CORRECTION The relative amounts of N13 and C11 were corrected     C2293  1   36 
           for the finite duration of the bombardments.           C2293  1   37
