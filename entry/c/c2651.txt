FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) Bevatron, a weak-focusing proton       C2651  1   10 
           synchrotron.                                           C2651  1   11 
INC-SPECT  The Bevatron beam incident upon the antiproton         C2651  1   12 
           production target was in the energy range 5.8 to 6.3   C2651  1   13 
           GeV. The internal beam intensity was from 2*10**10 to  C2651  1   14 
           3*10**10 protons per pulse, one pulse every 6 seconds. C2651  1   15 
           The production targets used were C or (CH2)n.          C2651  1   16 
DETECTOR   (SCIN,CEREN) The velocity was determined by the use    C2651  1   17 
           of Cherenkov counters that discriminated against pions C2651  1   18 
           but were sensitive to antiprotons. These counters      C2651  1   19 
           consisted of liquid styrene radiators (index of        C2651  1   20 
           refraction 1.543) viewed by one RCA-6810               C2651  1   21 
           photomultiplier tube. The annihilation events were     C2651  1   22 
           separately detected in Counter C*, which was a         C2651  1   23 
           Cherenkov counter containing methyl alcohol (index of  C2651  1   24 
           refraction 1.33).                                      C2651  1   25 
METHOD     (ASEP,COINC) The mass spectrograph, which gave a       C2651  1   26 
           signal whenever an antiproton passed through it. The   C2651  1   27 
           spectrograph contained several improvements that       C2651  1   28 
           greatly increased the luminosity of the apparatus.     C2651  1   29 
           This was accomplished by increasing the aperture of    C2651  1   30 
           the spectroscope and, also, by accepting a momentum    C2651  1   31 
           interval of 3% instead of only 1% as before. This      C2651  1   32 
           relaxation of the momentum definition made the mass    C2651  1   33 
           determination less precise, but once antiprotons had   C2651  1   34 
           been identified, we could afford this uncertainty.     C2651  1   35 
           Nuclear-emulsion studies of annihilations of           C2651  1   36 
           antiprotons have shown that nearly all annihilations   C2651  1   37 
           give rise to fast charged pions (fast enough to give   C2651  1   38 
           detectable light in methyl alcohol) or neutral pions   C2651  1   39 
            (whose gamma rays frequently are converted within     C2651  1   40 
           Counter C* and give detectable Cherenkov radiation).   C2651  1   41 
           Each antiproton indicated by the mass spectrograph     C2651  1   42 
           was considered an annihilation if it was accompanied   C2651  1   43 
           by a pulse in the C* counter, irrespective of whether  C2651  1   44 
           counts were registered by other counters. If no pulse  C2651  1   45 
           was seen in the C* counter, then the presence or       C2651  1   46 
           absence of pulses in other counters indicated whether  C2651  1   47 
           the antiproton in question passed through without      C2651  1   48 
           scattering (actually, scattered to an angle smaller    C2651  1   49 
           than 14.3 degrees), or scattered to an angle between   C2651  1   50 
           14.3 and 20.5 degrees, or scattered to an angle        C2651  1   51 
           greater than 20.5 degrees.                             C2651  1   52 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The statistical errors in the determination    C2651  1   53 
           of the cross sections are given by the formula dsigma  C2651  1   54 
           thetac = (1/N)*[(1/(I thetac))-(1/(I0)) ]**0.5,        C2651  1   55 
           where N is the thickness of the absorber in the slots  C2651  1   56 
           in nuclei per square centimeter, I0 the number of      C2651  1   57 
           incident particles, I thetac is the number of          C2651  1   58 
           pass-through particles with a cutoff angle thetac.     C2651  1   59 
           Some other systematic error will be shown by further   C2651  1   60 
           experiments.                                           C2651  1   61
