DETECTOR   (PROPC) An end window, methane gas-flow, proportional  C197900100010 
           beta counter.                                          C197900100011 
METHOD     (ACTIV,BSPEC,INTB,STTA) The boron nitride powder was   C197900100012 
           held in place by two aluminum foils. Two additional    C197900100013 
           aluminum foils were placed behind the target. All      C197900100014 
           irradiation between 0.4 and 0.72 GeV were performed    C197900100015 
           at the Berkeley 184-in synchrocyclotron while those    C197900100016 
           between 2.0 and 6.2 GeV were carried out at Berkeley   C197900100017 
           Bevatron.                                              C197900100018

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The number of counts per minute, at the end    C197900100020 
           of bombardment, was obtained from the decay curve by   C197900100021 
           resolution of the 10 min N-13 from the other           C197900100022 
           activities (mainly 20.5-min C-11) detected. This was   C197900100023 
           done by making the decay curve analysis first by hand  C197900100024 
           and then with the aid of an IBM-704 least square       C197900100025 
           program called "Frenic". The least square program      C197900100026 
           gave the number of counts of each component and its    C197900100027 
           standard deviation.                                    C197900100028
