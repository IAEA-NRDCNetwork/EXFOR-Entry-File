DETECTOR   (IOCH) The amounts of the various alpha-emitting       C2305  1   10 
           products were determined by use of 52%-geometry        C2305  1   11

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors are due principally to           C2305  1   14 
           uncertainties in determining the amount of target      C2305  1   15

SAMPLE     The radium used was isotopically pure Ra226. The       C2305  2    4 
           targets were prepared by electrodeposition of the      C2305  2    5 
           various materials onto gold or aluminum foils.         C2305  2    6 
METHOD     (REC,CHSEP,ACTIV) The radium targets were dissolved    C2305  2    7 
           after each bombardment and plutonium and thorium       C2305  2    8 
           fractions, respectively, were isolated                 C2305  2    9 
           radiochemically. A recoil technique was used for the   C2305  2   10 
           thorium cross-section measurements.                    C2305  2   11
