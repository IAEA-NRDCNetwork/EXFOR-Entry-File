DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,SISD) Each pair of charged particle decay  C190600100016 
           products was detected in coincidence using six 5cm x   C190600100017 
           5cm position-sensitive E-dE telescopes located 46 cm   C190600100018 
           downstream of the target, allowing for the             C190600100019 
           measurement of energy, position, and particle type.    C190600100020 
           Two of the telescopes covered laboratory angles of     C190600100021 
           2.5deg to 8.5deg on both sides of the beam axis and    C190600100022 
           were optimized to measure heavier particles 15-O and   C190600100023 
           18F. The remaining four telescopes covered laboratory  C190600100024 
           angles 10.5deg to 16.5deg on both sides of the beam    C190600100025

           protons and alpha particles. Neutrons were not         C190600100027 
           detected.                                              C190600100028

PART-DET   (A) Alpha particles were detected in telescopes at     C190600200006 
                laboratory angles from 10.5 to 16.5 deg.          C190600200007 
           (8-O-15) Oxygen nuclei were detected using telescopes  C190600200008 
                    at laboratory angles from 2.5 to 8.5 deg.     C190600200009 
ANALYSIS   Data are deduced from alpha-decay channel              C190600200010 
            19F-> 15-O + alpha. From momenta of detected oxygen   C190600200011 
            nucleus and alpha particle, momentum of 19F is        C190600200012 
            calculated. Angular distribution of missing neutron   C190600200013

STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from tab.1 of the reference         C190600300005 
PART-DET   (P) Protons were  detected in telescopes at            C190600300006 
                laboratory angles from 10.5 to 16.5 deg.          C190600300007 
           (9-F-18) Fluorine nuclei were detected using telescope C190600300008 
                    at laboratory angles from 2.5 to 8.5 deg.     C190600300009 
ANALYSIS   Resonance properties were determined from proton       C190600300010 
           breakup of 19Ne leading to p+18F. Proton break-up      C190600300011
