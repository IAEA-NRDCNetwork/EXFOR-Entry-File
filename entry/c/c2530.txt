METHOD     (CHSEP,REC,ACTIV) As no At211 was produced in the HilacC2530  1   12 
           bombardments, it was possible to determine chemical    C2530  1   13 
           yields by using At211 as a tracer. Following the       C2530  1   14 
           heavy-ion bombardment, the recoil catcher containing   C2530  1   15 
           the heavy-ion-produced activities and a plate          C2530  1   16 
           containing a known amount of tracer activity were      C2530  1   17 
           simultaneously dissolved in 8M HCl. The astatine was   C2530  1   18 
           separated from other alpha-emitting activities         C2530  1   19 
            (mainly polonium) by extraction into di-isopropyl     C2530  1   20 
           ether (DIPE) . The DIPE fraction was transferred to a  C2530  1   21 
           platinum counting disk and evaporated to dryness       C2530  1   22 
           under a heat lamp. The only absolute counting was      C2530  1   23 
           that of the plates containing At211 tracer. The alpha  C2530  1   24 
           particles from At211 (and EC daughter, Po211) were     C2530  1   25 
           counted in an ionization chamber having 50% geometry.  C2530  1   26 
           In "ratio experiments", stacked foils (consisting of   C2530  1   27 
           gold targets and aluminum foils) were bombarded and    C2530  1   28 
           the ratios of production of low-activity astatine      C2530  1   29 
           nuclides to that of the prominent activities were      C2530  1   30 
           measured. For measurements of Pt(N14,xn) cross         C2530  1   31 
           sections, in addition to other types of experiments,   C2530  1   32 
           it was necessary to do ratio experiments.              C2530  1   33 
ANALYSIS   Cross sections were calculated in the usual manner,    C2530  1   34 
           using the branching ratios and half-lives listed.      C2530  1   35 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The limits of error given for these cross   C2530  1   36 
           sections represent estimated uncertainties in the      C2530  1   37 
           positions of the smoothed curves. These estimates, as  C2530  1   38 
           well as the limits of error given for the other cross  C2530  1   39 
           sections, include uncertainties in the counting rates  C2530  1   40 
           of the radiations from the product nuclei, target      C2530  1   41 
           thickness, and decay during bombardment corrections.   C2530  1   42
