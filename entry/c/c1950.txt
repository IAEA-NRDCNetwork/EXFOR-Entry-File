FACILITY   (LINAC,1USALAS)Irradiations at 200 MeV were performed  C195000100012 
           at Alamos Neutron Science Center(LANSCE) facility      C195000100013 
           using the dual-energy capability of the 800 MeV        C195000100014 
           side-coupled cavity linac. Irradiations at 100 MeV     C195000100015 
           were performed at the LANSCE Isotope Production        C195000100016 
           Facility, using proton beam from a drift tube linac    C195000100017 
SAMPLE     Natural Th target was used. A target stack comprised   C195000100018 
           six foil packets,each packet containing two thorium    C195000100019 
           foils and one aluminum monitor foil. Natural thorium   C195000100020 
           foils were of 99.7% purity.The foils had the           C195000100021 
           dimensions of approximately 2.5cm x 2.5 cm and had     C195000100022 
           thicknesses ranging from 60.5 to 70.5 mg/cm2.          C195000100023 
           A similar sized aluminum beam current monitoring foil  C195000100024 
           of 99.9% purity with a thickness of approximately      C195000100025 
           65 mg/cm2 was incorporated downstream of each set of   C195000100026 
           thorium foils. All foils were sandwiched between       C195000100027 
           single layers of 25 mu-m thick Kapton tape, which      C195000100028 
           served as a catcher foil for recoil ions.              C195000100029 
DETECTOR   (GELI,HPGE)The thorium foils were counted on an ORTEC  C195000100030 
           GEM10P4-70 detector with a relative efficiency of 10%, C195000100031 
           while the aluminum foils were counted on a Princeton   C195000100032 
           Gamma-tech lithium-drifted germanium Ge(Li)detector    C195000100033 
           with a relative efficiency of 13.7%.                   C195000100034 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Cross sections were determined from analysis   C195000100035

           several months.                                        C195000100037
