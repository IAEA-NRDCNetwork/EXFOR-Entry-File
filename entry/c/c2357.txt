SAMPLE     A target stack consisted of a 0.001-in. Al target foil C2357  1   11 
            (99.99% pure) and three 0.00025-in.                   C2357  1   12

METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) The irradiations were performed at the   C2357  1   14 
           Brookhaven Cosmotron and AGS, and at the latter        C2357  1   15 
           machine it was necessary to reduce the beam intensity  C2357  1   16 
           to prevent the burning of the plastic foils. The       C2357  1   17 
           irradiations sometimes lasted as long as 20 min, but   C2357  1   18 
           corrections were made for the variation of the beam    C2357  1   19 
           intensity during the bombardments. The Mg27 was        C2357  1   20 
           separated chemically from the target and catcher       C2357  1   21 
           foils, and the main problem was eliminating the        C2357  1   22 
           tremendous quantities of C11 activity induced in the   C2357  1   23 
           plastic foils. This was accomplished by fuming off     C2357  1   24 
           the carbon with perchloric acid. The other             C2357  1   25 
           interfering activities, F18 and Na24, were eliminated  C2357  1   26 
           with holdback carriers. The samples were mounted on    C2357  1   27 
           Al cards of sufficient thickness to stop the beta      C2357  1   28 
           particles and assayed on NaI crystals.                 C2357  1   29 
CORRECTION Data were corrected for the secondary reaction and     C2357  1   30 
           scattering.                                            C2357  1   31
