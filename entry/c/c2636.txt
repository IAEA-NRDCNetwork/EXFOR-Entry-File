ANALYSIS   Assume that we deal with p-p scattering of the         C2636  3    4 
           impinging proton by an individual proton in the        C2636  3    5 
           lithium nucleus. After the collision, the two protons  C2636  3    6 
           escape without suffering any other collision;          C2636  3    7 
           otherwise they would not be detected by the counter    C2636  3    8 
           arrangement used. The protons in the lithium nucleus,  C2636  3    9 
           however, are not at rest and in applying the           C2636  3   10 
           conservation of energy and momentum to the system we   C2636  3   11 
           shall take into account, by some admittedly crude      C2636  3   12 
           assumptions, the internal motion of the protons and    C2636  3   13 
           their binding energy.                                  C2636  3   14
