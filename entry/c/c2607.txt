FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The 184-inch Berkeley cyclotron.       C2607  1    9 
INC-SPECT  The deuterons produced by the cyclotron have           C2607  1   10 
           a maximum energy of 190 MeV, and a beam of about       C2607  1   11 
           10**-6-amp average current can be obtained. The        C2607  1   12 
           protons have a maximum energy of 340 MeV and can be    C2607  1   13 
           produced with an average beam current of the order of  C2607  1   14 
           5*10**-7 amp.                                          C2607  1   15 
DETECTOR   (FISCH,GEMUC) Bi fission chamber.                      C2607  1   16 
METHOD     Bismuth fission chambers were used to detect the high  C2607  1   17 
           energy neutrons. Graphite monitors were used to        C2607  1   18 
           determine the fluxes of protons or deuterons           C2607  1   19 
           traversing the targets. The monitors were attached to  C2607  1   20 
           the target so that the beam passed, simultaneously,    C2607  1   21 
           through both target and monitor. At the end of the     C2607  1   22 
           bombardment the monitor was removed and the counting   C2607  1   23 
           rate of the C11 activity in it was determined on a     C2607  1   24 
           Geiger-Mueller counter at a suitable later time.       C2607  1   25 
           Sometimes decay curves were taken through an aluminum  C2607  1   26 
           absorber so that the positron annihilation radiation   C2607  1   27 
           of the C11 was counted instead of the positrons        C2607  1   28 
           themselves.                                            C2607  1   29 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY)                                                C2607  1   30 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The relative neutron yield from a given     C2607  1   31 
           element was obtained by comparison of its corrected    C2607  1   32 
           neutron yield to the yield from a standard carbon      C2607  1   33 
           target. The estimated probable error of a single       C2607  1   34 
           determination of such a ratio is about 10 percent.     C2607  1   35 
           This error arises mainly in the determination of the   C2607  1   36 
           flux of deuterons or protons traversing a target, but  C2607  1   37 
           also has contributions from the neutron counting       C2607  1   38 
           statistics and from the correction made for the        C2607  1   39 
           production of neutrons in the carbon monitors. The     C2607  1   40 
           errors in measurements of the thicknesses and          C2607  1   41 
           densities of the targets are negligible.               C2607  1   42 
CORRECTION For each of the four targets used in a given run, the  C2607  1   43 
           neutron counting rate was determined and corrected     C2607  1   44 
           for the neutrons produced in the monitors and the      C2607  1   45 
           relative neutron yields for the four targets were      C2607  1   46 
           calculated.                                            C2607  1   47
