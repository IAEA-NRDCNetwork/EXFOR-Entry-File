           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using       C197000100012 
           A1200 fragment separator.                              C197000100013 
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes  C197000100014 
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and      C197000100015 
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists    C197000100016 
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric    C197000100017 
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)       C197000100018 
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three        C197000100019 
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,       C197000100020 
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,            C197000100021 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C197000100022 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C197000100023 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C197000100024 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C197000100025 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C197000100026 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C197000100027 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C197000100028 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C197000100029 
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a      C197000100030 
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.      C197000100031 
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin      C197000100032 
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator      C197000100033 
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed   C197000100034 
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI              C197000100035 
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by      C197000100036 
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling  C197000100037 
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage      C197000100038 
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.    C197000100039
