FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USACLA) Experiment performed using deflected   C200200100008 
           beam of the U.C.L.A. cyclotron,                        C200200100009 
SAMPLE     Stack of spectroscopically pure Nb(2)O(5) samples      C200200100010 
           with weight of 40 to 50 mg were irradiated in          C200200100011 
           circulating beam of cyclotron. The desired energy      C200200100012 
           being selected by position of the target probe.        C200200100013 
DETECTOR   (GEMUC) Decay curves and absorption curves were        C200200100014 
           obtained with a thin window Geiger-Mueller tube        C200200100015 
           (SCIN) Gamma-ray spectra were measured with the use    C200200100016 
           of the scintillation gamma-ray spectrometer. Thin      C200200100017 
           samples were prepared and the particles studied by     C200200100018 
           means of the helical focusing beta-ray spectrometer.   C200200100019 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used.The 0.262-MeV       C200200100020 
           gamma ray of 93Mo is largely converted, while the      C200200100021 
           other two (0.69 and 1.51 MeV) are not converted to     C200200100022 
           any appreciable extent. These conversion electrons     C200200100023 
           are responsible for essentially all of the radiation   C200200100024 
           detected in the Geiger-Mueller tubes used here, as     C200200100025 
           was shown by aluminum and lead absorption curves.      C200200100026 
           These absorption curves were extrapolated to zero      C200200100027 
           absorber thickness and the total number of             C200200100028

COMMENT    The paper contains cross section of the reaction       C200200100030 
               Nb-93(p,np)Nb-92-(M2)                              C200200100031 
           with half-life of 13 hr. Because this state was never  C200200100032 
           confirmed, this cross section is not compiled.         C200200100033
