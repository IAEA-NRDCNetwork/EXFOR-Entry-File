DETECTOR   (NAICR) The gamma-ray spectrometer itself consisted    C1122  1   12 
           of a 20.32 cm diameter by 10.16 cm thick NaI(Tl)       C1122  1   13 
           crystal coupled through a linear amplifier to a 1600   C1122  1   14 
           channel pulse height analyzer.                         C1122  1   15

           (IOCH) Ion chambers ICl-3: The readout from these      C1122  1   17 
           chambers provided a monitor for the stability of the   C1122  1   18 
           beam at the high intensities. These ion chamber        C1122  1   19 
           readings were also used to record the time             C1122  1   20 
           distribution of the incident beam during the course of C1122  1   21 
           a given irradiation.                                   C1122  1   22 
SAMPLE     A polystyrene target consisted of a 3.81 cm diameter   C1122  1   23 
           circular disk which was closely fitted inside a        C1122  1   24 
           circular annulus whose diameter was 7.62 cm. The       C1122  1   25 
           pieces were constructed to have parallel faces and a   C1122  1   26 
           nominal thickness of 1.57 mm. The carbon content       C1122  1   27 
            (12C+13C) of polystyrene is 91.5% carbon by weight.   C1122  1   28 
           Each graphite target block had nominal dimensions of   C1122  1   29 
            (5.1 x 5.1x2.54 cm3). The dimensions and weight of    C1122  1   30 
           each graphite target used were measured and recorded.  C1122  1   31 
METHOD     (EXTB,ACTIV) The duration of the entire irradiation    C1122  1   32 
           procedure was about 3-4 hours. During the              C1122  1   33 
           irradiations, the beam position and intensity were     C1122  1   34 
           visually monitored on a pulse-by-pulse basis, and the  C1122  1   35 
           accumulated incident flux was manually recorded after  C1122  1   36 
           every 10 spills. The 11C was counted using a NaI(Tl)   C1122  1   37 
           gamma-ray spectrometer. An irradiated polystyrene      C1122  1   38 
           target was sandwiched between a pair of 0.157 cm       C1122  1   39 
           thick copper plates, an the gamma rays from the        C1122  1   40 
           annihilation of the beta+ from the 11C decay were      C1122  1   41 
           measured in the spectrometer. The central disk and     C1122  1   42 
           the annulus of each polystyrene target were counted    C1122  1   43 
           separately.                                            C1122  1   44 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Systematic plus statistical. The errors in     C1122  1   45 
           the cross section are dominated by possible counting   C1122  1   46 
           losses in the two scintillator system and effects due  C1122  1   47 
           to slight misalignment of the beam.                    C1122  1   48 
           (ERR-1) Possible counting losses as reflected by the   C1122  1   49 
           difference in counts between the two sets of           C1122  1   50 
           electronics never amounted to more than 2%.            C1122  1   51 
           (ERR-2) An error contribution of 2% was assigned to    C1122  1   52 
           allow for possible slight misalignment of the beam     C1122  1   53
