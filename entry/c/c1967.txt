DETECTOR   (NAICR) Core of the SuN (Summing NaI(Tl)) is a         C196700100017 
           cylinder,16in. in diameter and 16in. long,with a       C196700100018 
           1.8in. diameter borehole along its axis. The cylinder  C196700100019 
           comprised two separate halves enclosed in aluminium    C196700100020 
           casings that allow for placing the detector around a   C196700100021 
           beam line. Within the two aluminium casings, each of   C196700100022 
           the halves is additionally divided into four           C196700100023
