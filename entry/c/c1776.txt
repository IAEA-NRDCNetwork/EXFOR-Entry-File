FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the Lawrence   C1776  1    9 
           Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron using C1776  1   10 
           newly implemented 242Pu target facility at the         C1776  1   11 
           Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS).                   C1776  1   12 
SAMPLE     A 9.5-cm diameter rotating target wheel containing     C1776  1   13 
           four target segments with 440, 340, 320, and 270       C1776  1   14 
           mu-g/cm2 of 242Pu in form PuO2 as PuO2 on 2.4 mu-m     C1776  1   15 
           thick Ti backing. Pu target was enriched in 242Pu      C1776  1   16 
           more than 99.9%.The targets were prepared by           C1776  1   17 
           molecular plating. 48Ca beam entered BGS through a     C1776  1   18 
           45 mu-g/cm2 thick carbon window.                       C1776  1   19 
DETECTOR   (MWPC,SISD) Focal plane detector consisted of          C1776  1   20 
           multiwire proportional counter, used to determine      C1776  1   21 
           time of flight and location of impact of evaporation   C1776  1   22 
           residues. Second focal plane detector consists of      C1776  1   23 
           48 Si-strips (three 6x6cm2 cards, sixteen strips each),C1776  1   24 
           which provide horizontal resolution and was used for   C1776  1   25 
           implantation of evaporation residues. Vertical positionC1776  1   26 
           was determined by resistive charge division within     C1776  1   27 
           each strip.                                            C1776  1   28
