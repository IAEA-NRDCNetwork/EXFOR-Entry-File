FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Experiment performed at the Lawrence   C177600100009 
           Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron using C177600100010 
           newly implemented 242Pu target facility at the         C177600100011 
           Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS).                   C177600100012 
SAMPLE     A 9.5-cm diameter rotating target wheel containing     C177600100013 
           four target segments with 440, 340, 320, and 270       C177600100014 
           mu-g/cm2 of 242Pu in form PuO2 as PuO2 on 2.4 mu-m     C177600100015 
           thick Ti backing. Pu target was enriched in 242Pu      C177600100016 
           more than 99.9%.The targets were prepared by           C177600100017 
           molecular plating. 48Ca beam entered BGS through a     C177600100018 
           45 mu-g/cm2 thick carbon window.                       C177600100019 
DETECTOR   (MWPC,SISD) Focal plane detector consisted of          C177600100020 
           multiwire proportional counter, used to determine      C177600100021 
           time of flight and location of impact of evaporation   C177600100022 
           residues. Second focal plane detector consists of      C177600100023 
           48 Si-strips (three 6x6cm2 cards, sixteen strips each),C177600100024 
           which provide horizontal resolution and was used for   C177600100025 
           implantation of evaporation residues. Vertical positionC177600100026 
           was determined by resistive charge division within     C177600100027 
           each strip.                                            C177600100028
