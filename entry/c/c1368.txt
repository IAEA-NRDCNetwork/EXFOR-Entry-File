INC-SOURCE (P-T) Target was bombarded with nearly monoenergetic   C136800100010 
            neutrons (DE = 60 keV). Neutrons were produced by use C136800100011 
            of the 3H(p, n)3He reaction (Q = -0.764 MeV)          C136800100012 
DETECTOR   (GE-IN) a BGO Compton-suppressed HPGe detector with a  C136800100013 
            relative efficiency of about 55% and an energy        C136800100014 
            resolution of 2.1 keV (FWHM) at 1332 keV.             C136800100015 
SAMPLE     A 4-g cylindrical metallic sample (height = 1.6 cm,    C136800100016 
            diameter = 0.7 cm) enriched to 99% in 112Sn.          C136800100017

MONITOR    The energy calibration was monitored with 24Na and     C136800100020 
            137Cs radioactive sources. Efficiency and energy      C136800100021 
            nonlinearity curves were determined with a 226Ra      C136800100022
