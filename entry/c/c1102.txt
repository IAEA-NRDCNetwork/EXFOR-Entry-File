SAMPLE     A series of three relatively thick (1 g/cm2) pure (>   C110200100012 
           99.999%) gold targets. The targets were sandwiched     C110200100013 
           between two gold catcher foils and wrapped in          C110200100014 
           aluminum foil.                                         C110200100015 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface-barrier detector.              C110200100016 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,PHD) After a suitable cooling period,     C110200100017 
           the gold targets were dissolved and a measured amount  C110200100018 
           of 160Tb tracer was introduced to monitor chemical     C110200100019 
           yield. The alpha-radioactivity measurements were       C110200100020 
           performed in vacuum using a silicon surface-barrier    C110200100021 
           detector coupled to a multichannel pulse-height        C110200100022 
           analyzer. Analysis of the pulse-height spectra and a   C110200100023 
           series of absorption measurements confirmed the        C110200100024 
           emission of 4 MeV alpha-particles from each of the     C110200100025 
           samples. Chemical yields were determined by            C110200100026 
           comparison of the 160Tb gamma-spectra of the various   C110200100027 
           samples with a similarly mounted sample prepared       C110200100028 
           directly from the tracer solution. (No correction for  C110200100029 
           160Tb produced by protons in the gold target was       C110200100030 
           needed since this amount was negligible compared to    C110200100031 
           the amount of tracer added.)                           C110200100032 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Somewhat arbitrarily, uncertainties of +-   C110200100033 
           40% (excluding the uncertainties due to beam energy    C110200100034 
           dispersion) have been assigned to the present data. A  C110200100035 
           main factor in this estimate are the uncertainties in  C110200100036 
           the incident proton intensities.                       C110200100037 
           (ERR-1,,5.) An upper limit of about 5% on the total    C110200100038 
           149Tb production from impurities in the gold was       C110200100039 
           calculated from Rudstam's empirical formula            C110200100040 
           (ERR-2,3.,4.) The contributions due to secondaries     C110200100041 
            (including both cascade and evaporation particles) to C110200100042 
           196Au were estimated to be between 3 and 4% at the     C110200100043 
           highest energy of this experiment using both           C110200100044 
           experimental and theoretical results.                  C110200100045
