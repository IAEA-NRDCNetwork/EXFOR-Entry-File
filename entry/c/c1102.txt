SAMPLE     A series of three relatively thick (1 g/cm2) pure (>   C1102  1   12 
           99.999%) gold targets. The targets were sandwiched     C1102  1   13 
           between two gold catcher foils and wrapped in          C1102  1   14 
           aluminum foil.                                         C1102  1   15 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Silicon surface-barrier detector.              C1102  1   16 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,PHD) After a suitable cooling period,     C1102  1   17 
           the gold targets were dissolved and a measured amount  C1102  1   18 
           of 160Tb tracer was introduced to monitor chemical     C1102  1   19 
           yield. The alpha-radioactivity measurements were       C1102  1   20 
           performed in vacuum using a silicon surface-barrier    C1102  1   21 
           detector coupled to a multichannel pulse-height        C1102  1   22 
           analyzer. Analysis of the pulse-height spectra and a   C1102  1   23 
           series of absorption measurements confirmed the        C1102  1   24 
           emission of 4 MeV alpha-particles from each of the     C1102  1   25 
           samples. Chemical yields were determined by            C1102  1   26 
           comparison of the 160Tb gamma-spectra of the various   C1102  1   27 
           samples with a similarly mounted sample prepared       C1102  1   28 
           directly from the tracer solution. (No correction for  C1102  1   29 
           160Tb produced by protons in the gold target was       C1102  1   30 
           needed since this amount was negligible compared to    C1102  1   31 
           the amount of tracer added.)                           C1102  1   32 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Somewhat arbitrarily, uncertainties of +-   C1102  1   33 
           40% (excluding the uncertainties due to beam energy    C1102  1   34 
           dispersion) have been assigned to the present data. A  C1102  1   35 
           main factor in this estimate are the uncertainties in  C1102  1   36 
           the incident proton intensities.                       C1102  1   37 
           (ERR-1,,5.) An upper limit of about 5% on the total    C1102  1   38 
           149Tb production from impurities in the gold was       C1102  1   39 
           calculated from Rudstam's empirical formula            C1102  1   40 
           (ERR-2,3.,4.) The contributions due to secondaries     C1102  1   41 
            (including both cascade and evaporation particles) to C1102  1   42 
           196Au were estimated to be between 3 and 4% at the     C1102  1   43 
           highest energy of this experiment using both           C1102  1   44 
           experimental and theoretical results.                  C1102  1   45
