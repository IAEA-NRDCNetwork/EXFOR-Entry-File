DETECTOR   (MAGSP,IOCH,SCIN) Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph   C3045001   16 
            (SE-SPS), where its two dipole magnets focused the    C3045001   17 
           charged particles toward the focal-plane detector.     C3045001   18 
           The detector includes a position-sensitive ionization  C3045001   19 
           chamber filled with isobutane gas, and a plastic       C3045001   20 
           scintillator for measuring the remaining energy of     C3045001   21 
           the particles after passing through the ionization     C3045001   22 
           chamber.                                               C3045001   23 
SAMPLE     (5-B-11,ENR=0.99) The first was a self-supporting 10B  C3045001   24 
           target containing 11B, 12C, and 16O contaminants with  C3045001   25 
           a total density of about 70 microg/cm2. The 11B        C3045001   26 
           contamination was on the order of 8%. To assist in     C3045001   27 
           the identification of states coming from the 11B(d,p)  C3045001   28 
           12B reaction caused by the 11B target contamination,   C3045001   29 
           data were taken at each angle with a second target     C3045001   30 
           enriched in 11B (>99%) with a density of about         C3045001   31 
           70 microg/cm2 on a 20 microg/cm2 carbon backing.       C3045001   32 
METHOD     The targets were installed in the sliding-seal         C3045001   33 
           scattering chamber upstream of the SE-SPS. Particle    C3045001   34 
           trajectories can be reconstructed and momentum         C3045001   35 
           spectra can be constructed by using the acquired       C3045001   36 
           position information from position-sensitive anode     C3045001   37 
           pickup pads with delay-line readout. Particle          C3045001   38 
            (reaction) identification is achieved by measuring    C3045001   39 
           the energy loss in the ionization chamber and the      C3045001   40 
           remaining energy with the plastic scintillator. The    C3045001   41 
           solid-angle acceptance of the SE-SPS was set at 4.6    C3045001   42 
           msr for this experiment. To determine differential     C3045001   43 
           cross sections at different scattering angles in the   C3045001   44 
           laboratory frame, measurements were performed from 10  C3045001   45 
           to 50 in 5 degree steps. The magnetic field of the     C3045001   46 
           spectrometer was set to measure the 11B excitation     C3045001   47 
           energy range from about 8.4 to 13.6 MeV.               C3045001   48

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Experimental uncertainties, they were       C3045002    5 
           dominated by a 15% uncertainty attributed the beam     C3045002    6 
           current integrator which is used to determine the      C3045002    7 
           number of incoming deuteron beam particles. Because    C3045002    8 
           of the large number of counts for each peak, the       C3045002    9 
           statistical uncertainties are very small. Thus, when   C3045002   10 
           combined, the error bars tend to be right around 15%   C3045002   11 
           for each data point.                                   C3045002   12
