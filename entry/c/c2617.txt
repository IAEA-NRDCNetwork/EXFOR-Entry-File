SAMPLE     The target was 50 mu-g/cm2 gold evaporated onto        C2617  1   10 
           0.008 cm thick aluminum foil.                          C2617  1   11 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) A 7.5 cm or a 2 mm NaI crystal                 C2617  1   12 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The (p,pn) reaction recoils were caught on a   C2617  1   13 
           cylindrically shaped aluminum catcher foil placed aboveC2617  1   14 
           or below the proton beam.                              C2617  1   15 
           (CHSEP) The catcher foil was cut into strips           C2617  1   16 
           corresponding to 10 degrees segments and the 196Au fromC2617  1   17 
           each strip was separated, purified and mounted using   C2617  1   18 
           standard radiochemical techniques.                     C2617  1   19 
           (INTB) The target was placed at 45 degrees in the      C2617  1   20
