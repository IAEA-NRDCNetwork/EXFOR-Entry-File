FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The measurements were performed at     C193800100012 
           the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National         C193800100013 
           Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory                   C193800100014 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Scattered projectiles exiting the target were  C193800100015 
           momentum analyzed in S800 spectrograph and identified  C193800100016 
           with the focal plane detector system on an             C193800100017 
           event-by-event basis.                                  C193800100018 
           (IOCH) Energy loss of scattered ions was measured by   C193800100019 
           the S800 ionization chamber                            C193800100020

           (DRFTC) Two position-sensitive cathode readout drift   C193800100023 
           chambers in the S800 focal plane provided xy           C193800100024 
           information which, when combined with ray tracing in   C193800100025 
           the spectrograph, allowed for an event-by-event        C193800100026

           (HPGE) The segmented germanium array, consisting of    C193800100029 
           17, 32-fold segmented, high-purity germanium           C193800100030 
           detectors, surrounded the Coulomb excitation target    C193800100031 
           in front of the S800 spectrograph to detect the        C193800100032 
           de-excitation gamma rays. The high degree of           C193800100033 
           segmentation of the gamma detectors enabled            C193800100034 
           event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of gamma rays    C193800100035 
           emitted in flight by the scattered projectiles with    C193800100036 
           velocities approx. 40% of velocity of light.           C193800100037 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between focal plane detector and   C193800100038 
           gamma detector array was required.                     C193800100039 
           Mass and charge of scattered ions were measured using  C193800100040 
           two-dimensional plot dE x TOF, where dE was measured   C193800100041 
           by ionization chamber and time of flight by a pair of  C193800100042 
           plastic scintillators. Coulomb excitation was selected C193800100043 
           by selection of events where the projectile scattering C193800100044 
           angle was lower than ANG-MAX                           C193800100045 
INC-SOURCE 58,60,62Cr beams were produced by projectile           C193800100046

           acceptance of the separator was set to 0.5% for 58Cr   C193800100049
