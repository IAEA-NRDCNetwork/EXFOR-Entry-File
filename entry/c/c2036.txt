SAMPLE     Differentially pumped windowless gas target. The       C203600100008 
           target which contains Deuteron gas was cylindrical, 5  C203600100009 
           cm in inner diameter, with its axis perpendicular to   C203600100010 
           the incident beam direction.                           C203600100011 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP,PROPC) Q-D magnetic spectrometer for detection  C203600100012 
           of 4 MeV 6Li ions and incident 6 MeV alpha particles.  C203600100013 
           The counter was filled with propane (C3H8) gas at a    C203600100014 
           pressure of about 1/20 atmosphere and operated in the  C203600100015 
           proportional counter region.                           C203600100016

METHOD     (PHD,ASPEC,REC) Particles were identified on the base  C203600100018 
           of their ranges together with pulse height             C203600100019 
           discrimination. The field of the magnetic              C203600100020 
           spectrometer was set to select triply charged 6Li ions.C203600100021 
ANALYSIS   (CHGDS) The present result gives the total cross       C203600100022 
           section as sigma = Y/ N*I, where I is the number of    C203600100023 
           incident particles, Y is yield and N is number of      C203600100024 
           target nuclei. The final result had to be corrected    C203600100025 
           for two factors: only 84% of 6Li ions were triply      C203600100026 
           charged; 10% beam current increase due to emission of  C203600100027 
           secondary electrons.                                   C203600100028
