           Graaff accelerator at the Laboratory for Experimental  C2155  1   10 
           Nuclear Astrophysics (LENA), which is part of the      C2155  1   11

           cyclotron resonance ion source was used for            C2155  1   14 
           measurements.                                          C2155  1   15 
SAMPLE     (8-O-16,ENR=0.116)                                     C2155  1   16

           (8-O-18,ENR=0.007) Targets of 17-O were prepared by    C2155  1   18 
           anodizing 0.5-mm-thick tantalum backings in 17-O       C2155  1   19 
           enriched water.The targets withstood beam charge       C2155  1   20 
           accumulations up to 55 C at a beam intensity of 2.0    C2155  1   21 
           mA without any degradation in the maximum height of    C2155  1   22 
           the yield curves. The width of the yield curves (i.e., C2155  1   23 
           the target thickness) reduced noticeably because of    C2155  1   24 
           target sputtering (at a rate of 0.07-0.22 keV/C,       C2155  1   25 
           depending on the target and the beam intensity).       C2155  1   26 
           Targets were discarded when the thickness degraded by  C2155  1   27 
           more than 25%, which typically occurred at charge      C2155  1   28 
           accumulations of 30 C.                                 C2155  1   29 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The LENA gamma-gamma coincidence spectrometer   C2155  1   30 
           consists of an 135% HPGe detector oriented at 0deg     C2155  1   31 
           with respect to the beam axis. The distance between    C2155  1   32 
           the HPGe detector and the target midpoint was 1.1 cm   C2155  1   33 
           and covered a large solid angle.                       C2155  1   34 
           (NAICR) HPGe detector was surrounded by a 16-segment   C2155  1   35 
           NaI(Tl) annulus, which provided almost 4Pi solid       C2155  1   36 
           angle coverage.                                        C2155  1   37 
           (SCIN) Plastic scintillator paddles of 5 cm thickness  C2155  1   38 
           covered the two counters on five sides and suppressed  C2155  1   39 
           cosmic-ray muon events.                                C2155  1   40 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between HPGe and NaI(Tl) crystal   C2155  1   41 
           was required. Timing gate was set sufficiently wide    C2155  1   42 
           to 500 ns  because of the long mean lifetime of the    C2155  1   43 
           Ex = 1121-keV level in 18F.                            C2155  1   44
