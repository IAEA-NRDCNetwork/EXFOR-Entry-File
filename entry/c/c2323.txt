SAMPLE     The targets consisted in most cases of                 C2323  1   11 
           self-supporting foils of highly enriched copper-65,    C2323  1   12 
           4-6 mg/cm2 in thickness. In some instances foils of    C2323  1   13 
           natural isotopic composition (1.8 mg/cm2 thick) were   C2323  1   14 
           also employed.                                         C2323  1   15 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The activity measurements were performed        C2323  1   16 
           with scintillation and gamma-gamma coincidence         C2323  1   17 
           spectrometers.                                         C2323  1   18 
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After bombardment, copper and gallium    C2323  1   19 
           were radiochemically separated from the various        C2323  1   20 
           samples.                                               C2323  1   21 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The estimated experimental error of 15-20%  C2323  1   22 
           includes the uncertainties in the disintegration rate  C2323  1   23 
           and chemical-yield determinations as well as the       C2323  1   24 
           effect of nonuniformity in the target thickness.       C2323  1   25
