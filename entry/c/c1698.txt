FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) Berkeley gas-filled separator (BGS) at C1698  1   15 
           the LBNL 88-inch cyclotron facility.                   C1698  1   16 
SAMPLE     The 208Pb target consisted of nine arc shaped segments,C1698  1   17 
           each with a 500-microg/cm2 thick lead layer            C1698  1   18 
           sandwiched between layers of carbon with thicknesses   C1698  1   19 
           of 40 microg/cm2 (facing the beam) and 2 microg/cm2.   C1698  1   20 
           These segments were mounted around the periphery of a  C1698  1   21 
           14-inch diameter wheel which was rotated to minimize   C1698  1   22 
           thermal stress on the target from beam heating.        C1698  1   23 
DETECTOR   (SISD,PGAC) Two silicon p-i-n detectors (mounted at    C1698  1   24 
           ~27 degrees with respect to the incident beam)         C1698  1   25 
           monitored the product of beam intensity and target     C1698  1   26 
           thickness by detecting beam particles that were        C1698  1   27 
           elastically scattered from the target. Parallel Plate  C1698  1   28 
           Avalanche Counters (PPACs) were provided by Michigan   C1698  1   29 
           State University.                                      C1698  1   30 
METHOD     (ASPEC,ASEP,TOF) The beam energies at the center of    C1698  1   31 
           the target were 306.7, 309.2, and 312.8 MeV. The BGS   C1698  1   32 
           spatially separated the recoiling fusion evaporation   C1698  1   33 
           residues (EVR's, E~70 MeV) in flight from both beam    C1698  1   34 
           particles and transfer reaction products on the basis  C1698  1   35 
           of their differing magnetic rigidities within the      C1698  1   36 
           separator's 0.88-torr helium atmosphere. At the BGS    C1698  1   37 
           focal plane, the EVR's were deposited into a           C1698  1   38 
           300-microm thick passivated ion implanted silicon      C1698  1   39 
           detector with an active area of 116 mm (horizontal) x  C1698  1   40 
           58 mm (vertical). Two chains of time- and position-    C1698  1   41 
           correlated events were observed. Each chain consisted  C1698  1   42 
           of the implantation of an evaporation residue          C1698  1   43 
           followed by the emission of alpha particles.           C1698  1   44 
ANALYSIS   (PES) The cross sections were calculated assuming      C1698  1   45 
           their values to be constant for all beam energies      C1698  1   46 
           throughout the target thickness.                       C1698  1   47
