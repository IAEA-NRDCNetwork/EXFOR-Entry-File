SAMPLE     Stopping natural boron target 3 mm thick and 25 mm in  C196000100011 
           a diameter.  Stopping sulfur hexafluoride gas cell.    C196000100012 
DETECTOR   (BGO,SCIN) The detector was 4 in. long and 4 in.       C196000100013 
           diameter cylindrical BGO detector from St. Gobain      C196000100014 
           with integrally mounted photomultiplier tube fitted    C196000100015 
           with a Hamamatsu base.                                 C196000100016 
PART-DET   (G) The measurements are for only the indicated        C196000100017 
           gamma-rays. Neutrons are  excluded by time-of-flight   C196000100018 
           gating in the B(d,gamma 15.1) measurements, and  the   C196000100019 
           alphas through atmospheric stopping in the F(p,a gamma)C196000100020 
            measurements.                                         C196000100021 
METHOD     (PHD,TOF) The normalization of the pulse height        C196000100022 
           spectra was completed by comparing the integrated      C196000100023 
           counts in the energy regions of interest to those in   C196000100024 
           the associated MCNP5 modeled pulse height spectra. A   C196000100025 
           pulsed and bunched incident beam allowed for signal    C196000100026 
           gating on time-of-flight spectra in order to reduce    C196000100027 
           background in the measurements.                        C196000100028 
ANALYSIS   The detector response function for both measurements   C196000100029 
           was modeled using MCNP5.                               C196000100030 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error analysis does include the values  C196000100031 
           for total errors, both  statistical and systematical   C196000100032 
           estimates are included.                                C196000100033
