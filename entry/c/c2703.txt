SAMPLE     CD2 target with thickness of 517 mu-g/cm2              C2703  1   14 
INC-SOURCE A primary beam of stable 23Na was accelerated by the   C2703  1   15 
           FN Tandem and linac to an energy of 115 MeV. The       C2703  1   16 
           primary 23Na beam was incident on a production target  C2703  1   17 
           filled with deuterium gas to produce a radioactive     C2703  1   18 
           beam of 24Na via the 23Na(d,p) 24Na reaction. The      C2703  1   19 
           production target was 40 mm long, with a 2.5-micron    C2703  1   20 
           HAVAR entrance and exit windows. Target was cooled     C2703  1   21 
           with liquid nitrogen to 77 K and was kept at 350 Torr. C2703  1   22 
DETECTOR   (SISD) Double-sided 300 mu-m thick Micron S2 silicon   C2703  1   23 
           detector placed 10.5 cm upstream from the target       C2703  1   24 
           position was used to detect light charged particles.   C2703  1   25 
           The angular coverage of the silicon detector was       C2703  1   26 
           161.6 deg to 173.7 deg in the laboratory frame.        C2703  1   27 
           (NAICR) Two NaI(Tl) detectors were placed close to 90  C2703  1   28 
           deg above and to the side of the target position to    C2703  1   29 
           monitor the isomeric content of the beam via the       C2703  1   30

           of the isomeric state to the ground state (t1/2 =      C2703  1   32 
           20.18 ms) of the 24Na beam.                            C2703  1   33 
           (IOCH) Downstream from the target position, an         C2703  1   34 
           ionization chamber collected the unreacted beam        C2703  1   35 
           and the heavy reaction products. The ionization        C2703  1   36 
           chamber had 80 mm section to measure energy loss       C2703  1   37 
           and a 200 mm section to measure total energy. It was   C2703  1   38 
           filled with isobutane at a pressure of 45 Torr.        C2703  1   39
