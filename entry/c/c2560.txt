SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum volatilization of      C2560  1   10 
           natural silicon onto thin nickel foils. The thickness  C2560  1   11 
           of the silicon was approximately 170 microg/cm2.       C2560  1   12

METHOD     The first experiment measured the cross section for    C2560  2    4 
           formation of 016 nuclei in various ground- or          C2560  2    5 
           excited-state combinations at a fixed center-of-mass   C2560  2    6 
           angle (90 degrees). This experiment was performed by   C2560  2    7 
           varying the forward folding angle of the two detectors,C2560  2    8 
           which were kept at equal angles with respect to the    C2560  2    9 
           beam. The angle defining detector subtended an angle   C2560  2   10 
           of 2.7 degree in the reaction plane, and the recoil    C2560  2   11 
           detector (with a circular collimator) subtended a      C2560  2   12 
           maximum angle of 8.6 degree.                           C2560  2   13
