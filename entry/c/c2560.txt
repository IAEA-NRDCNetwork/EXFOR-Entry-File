SAMPLE     Targets were prepared by vacuum volatilization of      C2560  1   10 
           natural silicon onto thin nickel foils. The thickness  C2560  1   11 
           of the silicon was approximately 170 microg/cm2.       C2560  1   12

           the incomplete detection discussed above and to the    C2560  1   18 
           uncertainty in the target thickness, is believed to    C2560  1   19

METHOD     The second type of experiment measured the angular     C2560  3    4 
           distribution for formation of the 016 fragments in     C2560  3    5 
           the ground state or with 6-7 MeV of excitation         C2560  3    6 
           energy. For this measurement the angle-defining        C2560  3    7 
           detector subtended 1.8 degree in the reaction plane,   C2560  3    8 
           while the recoil collecting detector subtended 3.1-4.5 C2560  3    9 
           degrees. Since the angle between the two oxygen        C2560  3   10 
           fragments is approximately 1 degree greater for 7 MeV  C2560  3   11 
           of excitation energy than for 6 MeV of excitation      C2560  3   12 
           energy, as many as 40% of the partners formed with 7   C2560  3   13 
           MeV of excitation energy may not have been detected    C2560  3   14 
           because the angle between the detectors was set to     C2560  3   15
