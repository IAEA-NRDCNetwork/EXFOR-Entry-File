DETECTOR   (SCIN) The use of scintillation counters ensured       C2637  1    9 
           counting efficiencies of substantially 100 percent     C2637  1   10

METHOD     (COINC) Attenuation of the external proton beam in     C2637  2    4 
           liquid hydrogen was measured with standard counting    C2637  2    5 
           techniques.                                            C2637  2    6 
ANALYSIS   The counting rate of counters 1-2-3 in                 C2637  2    7 
           coincidence was subtracted from the 1-2 coincidence    C2637  2    8 
           rate and divided by the latter to obtain the           C2637  2    9 
           attenuation occurring between counters 2 and 3. The    C2637  2   10 
           difference in this quantity for the target filled      C2637  2   11 
           with liquid hydrogen and for the empty target is       C2637  2   12 
           attributed to scattering of the beam through an angle  C2637  2   13 
           greater than the average half-angle subtended by the   C2637  2   14 
           rear counter (No. 3).                                  C2637  2   15
