FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the    C2683  1   14 
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at       C2683  1   15 
           Michigan State University                              C2683  1   16 
SAMPLE     9Be secondary target with thickness of 375 mg/cm2      C2683  1   17 
DETECTOR   The particle identification for the incoming and       C2683  1   18 
           outgoing ions was performed on an event-by-event       C2683  1   19 
           basis using the standard A1900 and S800 focal-plane    C2683  1   20 
           detectors                                              C2683  1   21 
           (PPAC) A set of parallel-plate avalanche counters      C2683  1   22 
           installed upstream of the reaction target was used to  C2683  1   23 
           determine the momentum of the incoming ions.           C2683  1   24 
           (HPGE) The reaction target was surrounded by the       C2683  1   25 
           state-of-the-art array of gamma ray detectors, Gamma   C2683  1   26 
           Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Array, GRETINA. The array  C2683  1   27 
           consisted of seven modules, each housing four high     C2683  1   28 
           purity germanium crystals and it was set up with four  C2683  1   29 
           modules at 58 deg and the remaining three at 90 deg    C2683  1   30 
           with respect to the beam axis.                         C2683  1   31 
CORRECTION Gamma ray energies were Doppler-corrected              C2683  1   32 
INC-SOURCE A 48Ca beam with energy of 140 MeV/nucleon impinged    C2683  1   33 
           on a 846 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target and produced          C2683  1   34 
           secondary beams of 33Mg and 34Si. The purification of  C2683  1   35 
           the projectile-like particles was achieved by a 300    C2683  1   36 
           mg/cm2 thick aluminum wedge degrader in the A1900      C2683  1   37 
           fragment separator. The beams of 33Mg and 34Si had     C2683  1   38 
           average on-target intensities of 620 and 5.2E+5 s-1    C2683  1   39 
           and purities of 15 and 66%, respectively.              C2683  1   40
