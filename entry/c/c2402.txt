METHOD     (ACTIV) Measurements were made for the purpose of      C2402  1   13 
           determining the excitation function of copper. A       C2402  1   14 
           preliminary experiment was made in which a pile of     C2402  1   15 
           ten copper foils, each 0.0001 in. thick, were exposed  C2402  1   16 
           so that the alpha-particle beam fell normally on the   C2402  1   17 
           first foil. Only the first five foils were found to    C2402  1   18 
           be active. A second experiment was performed with      C2402  1   19 
           five 0.0001 in. copper foils and the activities were   C2402  1   20 
           followed on an electroscope for 35 hours. The          C2402  1   21 
           stopping power of the foils was determined by          C2402  1   22 
           observing visually the decrease in range of the        C2402  1   23 
           alpha-particle beam in air on introducing the five     C2402  1   24 
           foils into its path. The range was found to be         C2402  1   25 
           decreased by 5 cm and, accordingly, it was assumed     C2402  1   26 
           that each foil was equivalent to 1 cm of air. The      C2402  1   27 
           range of the beam in air was 11.5 cm.                  C2402  1   28 
CORRECTION The results for the short and long periods were        C2402  1   29 
           corrected to infinite bombardment (after twenty        C2402  1   30 
           minutes bombardment the first foil showed initial      C2402  1   31 
           activities of 1.5 and 0.165 electroscope divisions     C2402  1   32 
           per second for the short and long periods,             C2402  1   33 
           respectively).                                         C2402  1   34 
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: the original mean alpha particle   C2402  1   35 
           range in cm of air was converted to energy using the   C2402  1   36 
           classical assumption of 1 MeV per cm. It is            C2402  1   37 
           reproducing 11 MeV cyclotron energy well. This         C2402  1   38 
           article represents one of the first activation         C2402  1   39
