           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using       C196500100012 
           A1200 fragment separator.                              C196500100013 
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes  C196500100014 
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and      C196500100015 
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists    C196500100016 
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric    C196500100017 
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)       C196500100018 
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three        C196500100019 
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,       C196500100020 
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,            C196500100021 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C196500100022 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C196500100023 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C196500100024 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C196500100025 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C196500100026 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C196500100027 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C196500100028 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C196500100029 
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a      C196500100030 
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.      C196500100031 
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin      C196500100032 
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator      C196500100033 
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed   C196500100034 
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI              C196500100035 
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by      C196500100036 
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling  C196500100037 
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage      C196500100038 
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.    C196500100039
