FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABNL) Experiment performed using fast        C201100100008 
           external beam (FEB) from the Alternating Gradient      C201100100009 
           Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory    C201100100010 
SAMPLE     The standard target assembly consisted of a central    C201100100011 
           20 mg/cm2 high-purity Al foil guarded on each side by  C201100100012 
           5 mg/cm2 Al. The guard foils were sufficiently thick   C201100100013 
           to compensate for 24Na recoil losses from the central  C201100100014 
           foil. Targets for early experiments contained          C201100100015 
           polyethylene foils to measure the                      C201100100016 
           27Al(p,3pn)24Na/12C(p,pn)11C ratio                     C201100100017 
DETECTOR   (GELI) Gamma rays from decay of 24Na were detected     C201100100018 
           with Ge(Li) detectors in two geometries, at nominal 5  C201100100019 
           and 10 cm distances from the cryostat face.            C201100100020 
METHOD     (ACTIV) A raw cross section for each experiment was    C201100100021 
            calculated from the mean 24Na disintegration rate     C201100100022 
            extrapolated to the midpoint of the irradiation and   C201100100023 
            the proton fluence determined by the current          C201100100024 
            transformers.                                         C201100100025

STATUS     (TABLE) Data taken from text p.42,43 of the reference  C201100200005 
ANALYSIS   Final result was determined from set of 32             C201100200006 
           independent measurements. From these measurements      C201100200007 
           unweighted mean value and standard deviation were      C201100200008 
           determined.                                            C201100200009
