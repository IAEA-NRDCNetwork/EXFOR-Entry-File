FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) The Chicago synchrocyclotron.          C2831001    9 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN) Five scintillation counters.              C2831001   10 
SAMPLE     The scatterer was a 4-in. vertical cylinder of liquid  C2831001   11 
           hydrogen contained in styrofoam walls.                 C2831001   12 
METHOD     (COINC) The p-p differential elastic scattering cross  C2831001   13 
           section at 90 degree baricentral angle has been        C2831001   14 
           measured for three proton energies and has been found  C2831001   15 
           to be independent of energy in this range. Sizable     C2831001   16 
           intensities of proton beams of a wide range in energy  C2831001   17 
           were obtained by the proper azimuthal positioning of   C2831001   18 
           a beryllium scattering target at 76 in. radius in the  C2831001   19 
           Chicago synchrocyclotron. The protons collimated by a  C2831001   20 
           channel in the heavy shield were of definite energy    C2831001   21 
           for a given target position. They were further         C2831001   22 
           analyzed by an additional magnet. The analyzed         C2831001   23 
           collimated beam was defined and measured before the    C2831001   24 
           scatterer by a telescope of 2 scintillation counters   C2831001   25 
            (1-2). Two scintillation counters (3 and 4) were      C2831001   26 
           placed on opposite sides of the beam, connected in     C2831001   27 
           coincidence with counters 1 and 2 in such a way that   C2831001   28 
           they counted the two elastically scattered protons in  C2831001   29 
           coincidence with the incident proton.                  C2831001   30 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) No details on sources of uncertainties.     C2831001   31 
CORRECTION In order to avoid counting loss corrections, a fifth   C2831001   32 
           counter which counted protons scattered out of the     C2831001   33 
           main beam was used to normalize the incident flux at   C2831001   34 
           low-beam intensities and to normalize the quadruple    C2831001   35 
           coincidence rate at high beam intensity.               C2831001   36
