DETECTOR   (HPGE) Gamma rays were detected using GRETINA (Gamma-  C2267  1   25 
           Ray Energy Tracking In-beam Nuclear Array) detectors   C2267  1   26 
           positioned at laboratory angles of 58deg and 90deg.    C2267  1   27 
           (MAGSP) The projectile-like reaction products were     C2267  1   28 
           identified with the S800 spectrograph downstream of    C2267  1   29 
           the GRETINA setup. The S800 was run in focused mode    C2267  1   30 
           in order to allow a large momentum acceptance. 31S15+  C2267  1   31 
           ions were clearly separated from other reaction        C2267  1   32 
           products, and a nearly 100 % acceptance at the S800    C2267  1   33 
           focal plane was determined.                            C2267  1   34 
METHOD     (COINC) Data acquisition was triggered by              C2267  1   35 
           coincidences between GRETINA and the first             C2267  1   36 
           scintillator at the focal plane of the S800.           C2267  1   37 
           Downscaled projectile-like singles events were also    C2267  1   38 
           accepted for minimum bias analysis                     C2267  1   39 
INC-SOURCE The 30MeV/u 30P15+ beam was produced inflight via      C2267  1   40 
           fragmentation reactions using a primary beam of        C2267  1   41 
           150MeV/u, 112 pnA 36Ar18+ ions to bombard a            C2267  1   42 
           1857mg/cm2 thick Be target. The A1900 high-resolution  C2267  1   43 
           fragment separator selected the ions of interest       C2267  1   44 
           based on the momentum/charge, p/q, ratio after they    C2267  1   45 
           had passed through a 450mg/cm2 thick Al wedge The      C2267  1   46 
           26Al beam had a high purity (97+-2)% and an average    C2267  1   47 
           intensity of (1.04+-0.08)E+6 particles per second.     C2267  1   48
