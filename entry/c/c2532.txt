SAMPLE     The target was prepared by subliming 259 microg of     C2532  1   12 
           249Cf as CfF3, onto a 27-microg/mm2 substrate of       C2532  1   13 
           99.999% pure Al.                                       C2532  1   14

METHOD     (ASPEC,ACTIV) Authors infer from these data that the   C2532  1   18 
           new activity decays by emission of 9.06- and 9.25-MeV  C2532  1   19 
           alpha particles to 259Rf and, therefore, can belong    C2532  1   20 
           only to 263Sg. Some 22 atoms of recoil-transferred     C2532  1   21 
           259Rf were observed to decay in the off-wheel          C2532  1   22 
           detectors. Shortly after these daughter events,        C2532  1   23 
           granddaughter 255No alpha particles were detected      C2532  1   24 
           from four off wheel daughter decays.                   C2532  1   25 
ANALYSIS   From the rate of producing our 263Sg activity, authors C2532  1   26 
           calculate a formation cross section.                   C2532  1   27

COMMENT    Very little of this activity was made by 180 ions of   C2532  2    4 
           91 and 100 MeV, indicating a rather narrow excitation  C2532  2    5 
           function, consistent with our calculated excitation    C2532  2    6 
           function for the reaction 249Cf(180,4n), which shows   C2532  2    7 
           a half-width of 7 MeV and a maximum cross section of   C2532  2    8
