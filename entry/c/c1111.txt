DETECTOR   (NAICR) The spectrometer consisted of two 7.6 cm       C1111001   13 
           diameter x 7.6 cm long NaI(Tl) detectors mounted       C1111001   14 
           collinearly in a lead encasement.                      C1111001   15 
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The cross sections were measured by      C1111001   16 
           using the activation technique in which the            C1111001   17

SAMPLE     (22-TI-46,ENR=0.86) Measurements we made with both     C1111002    4 
           enriched and natural targets. One 46Ti target          C1111002    5 
           enriched to 86% abundance was made by evaporation.     C1111002    6 
           The thickness of this target was also determined by    C1111002    7 
           comparing its yield to that of the natural abundance   C1111002    8 
           targets but at an incident lab energy of 1.22 MeV.     C1111002    9 
           Titanium targets of naturally occurring abundances     C1111002   10 
           were prepared by evaporation onto 0.5 mm tantalum      C1111002   11 
           pieces. Titanium targets were ~400 microg/cm2 thick.   C1111002   12
