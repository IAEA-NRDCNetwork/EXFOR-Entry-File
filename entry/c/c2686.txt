SAMPLE     Be target with thickness of 1 mm                       C2686  1   16 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SISD,CSICR) Forward-emitted charged particles   C2686  1   17 
           were detected in the high resolution array located     C2686  1   18 
           80-cm downstream of the target and covered scattering  C2686  1   19 
           angles from 2.1 deg to 12.4 deg. The array contained   C2686  1   20 
           14 dE-E telescopes each consisting of a 1.5 mm thick   C2686  1   21 
           double-sided Si strip dE detector followed by a 4-cm-  C2686  1   22 
           thick CsI(Tl) E detector. The dE detectors are 6.4 cm  C2686  1   23 
           x 6.4 cm in area, with each face divided into 32       C2686  1   24 
           strips. Each E detector consisted of four separate     C2686  1   25 
           CsI(Tl) elements, each spanning a quadrant of the      C2686  1   26 
           preceding Si detector.                                 C2686  1   27

INC-SOURCE Secondary beam of 13-O was produced from primary 16-O  C2686  1   29 
           beam on Be target at energy of 150 MeV/A. The beam     C2686  1   30 
           was purified using the A1900 magnetic spectrometer     C2686  1   31 
           and the radio frequency fragment separator and had an  C2686  1   32 
           intensity of 10+3 pps with purity of 80%.              C2686  1   33
