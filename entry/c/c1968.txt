FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) Experiment was performed at the Nuclear C196800100012 
           Science Lab at the University of Notre Dame using      C196800100013 
           11 MV FN tandem accelerator                            C196800100014 
SAMPLE     Helium gas cell target separated by a 2.5 mu-m thick   C196800100015 
           Ni foil (99.95%) from the beamline. High-purity helium C196800100016 
           filled the gas cell at the pressure of 5 Torr. The     C196800100017 
           pressure and flow was controlled by a gas handling     C196800100018 
           system which held the gas cell at constant pressure.   C196800100019 
           A 0.25 mm thick Al foil (99.999%) was placed 24 cm     C196800100020 
           from the entrance foil to collect the 36Cl produced.   C196800100021 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Inverse kinematics was used and forward going  C196800100022 
           reaction products 36Cl were collected by a Al foil     C196800100023 
           (AMS) Samples, chemicaly treated to form AgCl were     C196800100024 
           measured using atomic mass spectroscopy with the       C196800100025

DETECTOR   (MAGSP) AMS used Browne-Buechner spectrograph in       C196800100029 
           which the ions are bent in a 1 m radius in a single    C196800100030 
           dipole magnet equipped with two detectors.             C196800100031 
           (PGAC)Parallel-Grid Avalanche Counter was placed at    C196800100032

ANALYSIS   The number of 36Cl nuclei produced, Y = 5.78E+9 atoms, C196800100037 
           was found by taking the amount of chlorine added to    C196800100038 
           the sample during chemical processing (55 mg) and the  C196800100039 
           36Cl/Cl concentration determined from the AMS          C196800100040 
           measurement. Energy interval represents energy loss    C196800100041 
           of incident particles in the target.                   C196800100042
