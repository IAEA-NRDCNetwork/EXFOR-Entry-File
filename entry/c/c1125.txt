SAMPLE     (6-C-14,ENR=0.55) Carbon targets 55% enriched in 14C.  C1125  1    7 
DETECTOR   (COIN) An anticoincidence crystal spectrometer.        C1125  1    8 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Enriched and regular carbon targets were       C1125  1    9 
           used. Both target measurements resulted in comparable  C1125  1   10 
           amounts of 7-N-16, which indicates that target         C1125  1   11 
           contaminants are responsible for 7-N-16 production.    C1125  1   12 
ANALYSIS   A qualitative upper limit for 6-C-14(d,gamma) cross    C1125  1   13 
           section was established by comparing C-15 and N-16     C1125  1   14 
           activities using the known 6-C-14(d,p) cross section.  C1125  1   15
