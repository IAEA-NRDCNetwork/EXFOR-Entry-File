SAMPLE     The target was pressed in the form of a rectangular    C0256  1   15 
           tablet (15x4x1 mm3) of scandium oxide. In the          C0256  1   16 
           scandium fraction, separated after the irradiation,    C0256  1   17 
           no isotopes with mass numbers > 44 have been found.    C0256  1   18 
           Those isotopes would be inevitably produced in the     C0256  1   19 
           presence of heavy target contaminants.                 C0256  1   20

METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP,INTB) Targets were irradiated in the      C0256  1   22 
           internal proton beam of the Joint Nuclear Research     C0256  1   23 
           Institute synchrocyclotron during 15-20 min. The       C0256  1   24 
           thickness of the target along the beam was ~ 1 mm.     C0256  1   25 
           The variation of the incident proton energy was        C0256  1   26 
           achieved by suitable choice of target radius. The      C0256  1   27 
           determination of the proton beam intensity was made    C0256  1   28 
           by the yield of the reaction A127(p,3pn) Na24. The     C0256  1   29 
           major mass of the irradiated target was dissolved in   C0256  1   30 
           the concentrated hydrochloric acid saturated with      C0256  1   31 
           gaseous HC1, 15 mg of the titanium carrier being       C0256  1   32 
           present.                                               C0256  1   33

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The above values are average from three or  C0256  1   37 
           four determinations, with standard errors. The total   C0256  1   38 
           accuracy of the cross section determination is ~ 10%   C0256  1   39 
           according to our evaluation. In our estimation as      C0256  1   40
