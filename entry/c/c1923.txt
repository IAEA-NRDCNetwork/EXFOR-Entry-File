FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the    C1923  1   15 
           Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National             C1923  1   16

SAMPLE     Be target with thickness of 705 mg/cm2                 C1923  1   19 
DETECTOR   (SPEC) After the reaction target a 4 Tm                C1923  1   20 
           superconducting magnet was used to bend by 43 deg and  C1923  1   21 
           analyse the emitted charged particles. Particles were  C1923  1   22 
           identified by series of energy and position sensitive  C1923  1   23 
           detectors in focal plane.                              C1923  1   24 
           (SCIN) Forward focused neutrons were detected using    C1923  1   25 
           Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), placed 6.05 m from the   C1923  1   26 
           target. MoNA consists of 144 individual detector       C1923  1   27 
           modules. Each module is based on a block of BC-408     C1923  1   28 
           plastic scintillator measuring 200 x 10 x 10 cm3.      C1923  1   29 
METHOD     Charged particle detectors and MoNA array provided     C1923  1   30 
           relativistic four-momentum vectors for 24-O nuclei     C1923  1   31 
           and neutrons, which were used to calculate the decay   C1923  1   32 
           energy of two- and three-body systems.                 C1923  1   33 
INC-SOURCE The primary beam of 140 MeV/A 48Ca bombarded a 1316    C1923  1   34 
           mg/cm2 9Be production target. The secondary beam 27F   C1923  1   35 
           with an energy of 82 MeV/A was separated from the      C1923  1   36 
           other reaction products and the primary beam using     C1923  1   37 
           the A1900 fragment separator. The 27F component of     C1923  1   38 
           the secondary beam was 7%. The main contaminant was    C1923  1   39 
           30Na. The 27F fragments were identified event by       C1923  1   40 
           event through the time of flight                       C1923  1   41
