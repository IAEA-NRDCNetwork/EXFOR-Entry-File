METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) Following irradiation, polonium     C1101  1   13 
           was chemically separated from the target and catcher   C1101  1   14 
           foils by spontaneous deposition on silver. The         C1101  1   15 
           radioactivity of the 207Po product was assayed with    C1101  1   16 
           thin NaI(Tl) X-ray detectors.                          C1101  1   17 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The decay curves were analysed with the CLSQ   C1101  1   18 
           least-squares program.                                 C1101  1   19 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,10.,15.) The random errors in both the       C1101  1   20 
           cross-section and range values are estimated as        C1101  1   21 
           10-15%, being comprised primarily of the uncertainty   C1101  1   22 
           in target thickness.                                   C1101  1   23

SAMPLE     (82-PB-206,ENR=0.974) Targets for these experiments    C1101  2    4 
           were prepared by electrodeposition of lead to a        C1101  2    5 
           thickness of 1 mg/cm2 onto thin nickel foil. The       C1101  2    6 
           target material consisted of highly enriched           C1101  2    7

           very pure (99.999%) aluminum foil having a surface     C1101  2    9 
           density of 5 mg/cm2. Stacks consisting of six          C1101  2   10 
           target-catcher pairs were mounted in a target holder   C1101  2   11
