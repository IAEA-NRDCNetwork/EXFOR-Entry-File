DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus          C1986  1   19 
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800     C1986  1   20 
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array   C1986  1   21 
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3      C1986  1   22 
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10    C1986  1   23 
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the     C1986  1   24 
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm, C1986  1   25 
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,           C1986  1   26 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C1986  1   27 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C1986  1   28 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C1986  1   29 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C1986  1   30 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C1986  1   31 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C1986  1   32 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C1986  1   33 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C1986  1   34 
           cm thick lead shield.                                  C1986  1   35 
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) Radioactive beams of carbon at       C1986  1   36 
           approximately 60 MeV/nucleon were produced by          C1986  1   37 
           fragmentation of an 80 MeV/nucleon 22Ne primary beam   C1986  1   38 
           on a thick 9Be target. These secondary beams were      C1986  1   39 
           purified in the A1200 fragment separator by the        C1986  1   40 
           combination of magnetic analysis and an intermediate   C1986  1   41 
           degrader. The resulting beam was delivered to the      C1986  1   42 
           experimental setup, consisting of three parts: a       C1986  1   43 
           dispersion-matching beam line, a target surrounded by  C1986  1   44 
           an array of NaI(Tl) gamma detectors, and the S800      C1986  1   45 
           spectrograph used for detecting the projectile         C1986  1   46 
           residues from the reaction. The excited states of the  C1986  1   47 
           residues were tagged by an inner ring of 11            C1986  1   48 
           cylindrical NaI(Tl) scintillators surrounding the      C1986  1   49 
           target. Each scintillator was read out by two          C1986  1   50 
           photomultiplier tubes, one at each end, thus allowing  C1986  1   51 
           the determination of both the energy and the           C1986  1   52 
           interaction point of the photon in the detector. The   C1986  1   53 
           position information provided by the array made it     C1986  1   54 
           possible to correct for the Doppler shift in the       C1986  1   55 
           energy of the gamma rays emitted by the fast           C1986  1   56 
            (beta=0.34) residues.                                 C1986  1   57 
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The intensities of the excited states of the     C1986  1   58 
           residues were extracted by fitting the measured        C1986  1   59 
           gamma-ray spectra with the line shapes generated by    C1986  1   60 
           simulations withe the Monte Carlo code GEANT. The      C1986  1   61 
           reliability of the simulations was tested by           C1986  1   62 
           comparing measured and simulated gamma-ray spectra     C1986  1   63 
           from calibration sources. The longitudinal momentum    C1986  1   64 
           distributions of the residues were reconstructed with  C1986  1   65 
           the ion optics code COSY INFINITY.                     C1986  1   66
