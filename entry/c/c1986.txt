DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus          C198600100017 
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800     C198600100018 
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array   C198600100019 
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3      C198600100020 
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10    C198600100021 
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the     C198600100022 
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm, C198600100023 
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,           C198600100024 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C198600100025 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C198600100026 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C198600100027 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C198600100028 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C198600100029 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C198600100030 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C198600100031 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C198600100032 
           cm thick lead shield.                                  C198600100033 
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) Radioactive beams of carbon at       C198600100034 
           approximately 60 MeV/nucleon were produced by          C198600100035 
           fragmentation of an 80 MeV/nucleon 22Ne primary beam   C198600100036 
           on a thick 9Be target. These secondary beams were      C198600100037 
           purified in the A1200 fragment separator by the        C198600100038 
           combination of magnetic analysis and an intermediate   C198600100039 
           degrader. The resulting beam was delivered to the      C198600100040 
           experimental setup, consisting of three parts: a       C198600100041 
           dispersion-matching beam line, a target surrounded by  C198600100042 
           an array of NaI(Tl) gamma detectors, and the S800      C198600100043 
           spectrograph used for detecting the projectile         C198600100044 
           residues from the reaction. The excited states of the  C198600100045 
           residues were tagged by an inner ring of 11            C198600100046 
           cylindrical NaI(Tl) scintillators surrounding the      C198600100047 
           target. Each scintillator was read out by two          C198600100048 
           photomultiplier tubes, one at each end, thus allowing  C198600100049 
           the determination of both the energy and the           C198600100050 
           interaction point of the photon in the detector. The   C198600100051 
           position information provided by the array made it     C198600100052 
           possible to correct for the Doppler shift in the       C198600100053 
           energy of the gamma rays emitted by the fast           C198600100054 
            (beta=0.34) residues.                                 C198600100055 
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The intensities of the excited states of the     C198600100056 
           residues were extracted by fitting the measured        C198600100057 
           gamma-ray spectra with the line shapes generated by    C198600100058 
           simulations withe the Monte Carlo code GEANT. The      C198600100059 
           reliability of the simulations was tested by           C198600100060 
           comparing measured and simulated gamma-ray spectra     C198600100061 
           from calibration sources. The longitudinal momentum    C198600100062 
           distributions of the residues were reconstructed with  C198600100063 
           the ion optics code COSY INFINITY.                     C198600100064
