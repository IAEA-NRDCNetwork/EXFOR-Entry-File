FACILITY   (VDGT,1USATNL) Experiment was performed at Triangle    C2209  1   10 
           Universities Nuclear Laboratory using the 10 MV FN     C2209  1   11 
           Tandem accelerator facility.                           C2209  1   12 
SAMPLE     (5-B-10,ENR=0.98) The target consisted of a thin 10B   C2209  1   13 
           layer with approx. 400 mu-g/cm2 nominal thickness,     C2209  1   14 
           deposited on a piece of tantalum that was thick        C2209  1   15 
           enough to stop all of the protons.                     C2209  1   16 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Annihilation photons were registered with two   C2209  1   17 
           LaBr3 crystal bars (4 in. long and with a 2 x 2        C2209  1   18 
            (in.)2 cross sectional area), optically coupled to    C2209  1   19 
           make a bar with dimensions 2 x 2 x 8 (in.)3 Two 8 in.  C2209  1   20 
           long LaBr3 detectors were placed outside the chamber   C2209  1   21 
           at a scattering angle of 90. on the left and the       C2209  1   22 
           right side of the beam at the distance of 2.5 cm from  C2209  1   23 
           the target.                                            C2209  1   24 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 10B target was irradiated for 1 h at each  C2209  1   25 
           of the proton energies . After each irradiation the    C2209  1   26 
           beam was interrupted and the two coincident 511 keV    C2209  1   27 
           gamma rays emitted by the activated target were        C2209  1   28 
           measured for another hour.                             C2209  1   29 
           (COINC) Coincidence between the two detectors was      C2209  1   30 
           required to measure annihilation gamma quanta.         C2209  1   31 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) Number of activated nuclei was determined by   C2209  1   32 
           analysis of decay 11C curve.                           C2209  1   33
