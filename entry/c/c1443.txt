TITLE      A study of alpha capture cross-sections of 112Sn       C144300100008 
FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator     C144300100009 
            at the University of Notre Dame, USA, in the energy   C144300100010 
            range 8-12 MeV                                        C144300100011 
INC-SPECT  112Sn targets were irradiated with an alpha beam in    C144300100012 
            the energy range between 8 and 12 MeV in energy steps C144300100013 
            of 0.5 MeV. The typical current recorded was between  C144300100014 
            100 and 250 nA                                        C144300100015 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The detection system was composed of two Clover C144300100016 
            Ge detectors (Clover 1 and Clover 2), each detector   C144300100017 
            having four HPGe crystals                             C144300100018 
SAMPLE     Isotopically enriched 112Sn targets in the form of     C144300100019 
            thin self-supporting foils of 2.2mg=cm2 were used for C144300100020 
            the measurements. The highly enriched (99.60 %)       C144300100021 
            112Sn targets were prepared at Argonne National       C144300100022 
            Laboratory via mechanical rolling                     C144300100023 
ERR-ANALYS The total error of the measured cross-section values   C144300100024 
             includes two components: statistical error based on  C144300100025 
             counting statistics (<20%) and systematical error    C144300100026 
             based on the errors in the procedural techniques     C144300100027 
             such as the error in the efficiency measurement      C144300100028 
             (10%), the error in the beam current integration     C144300100029 
             (2%), and target thickness (5%). These components    C144300100030 
             were added in quadrature.                            C144300100031
