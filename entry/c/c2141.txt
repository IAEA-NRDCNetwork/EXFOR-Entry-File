FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAFSU) The experiment was performed using FN   C2141  1    9 
           tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at the John D. Fox    C2141  1   10 
           superconducting linear accelerator facility at Florida C2141  1   11 
           State University.                                      C2141  1   12 
SAMPLE     Several 6Li targets of thicknesses of about 50mu-g/cm2 C2141  1   13 
           were used in experiment.The 6Li targets were prepared  C2141  1   14 
           under vacuum and transported to the chamber in a       C2141  1   15 
           vacuum container to prevent oxidation. Measurements of C2141  1   16 
           target thickness was performed in situ by using 16O +  C2141  1   17 
           6Li elastic scattering data.                           C2141  1   18 
DETECTOR   (TELES,MWPC,SI) The identification of the reaction     C2141  1   19 
           products was performed using two dE-E telescopes.Each  C2141  1   20 
           dE-E telescope was composed of four pin diode 2x2 cm2  C2141  1   21 
           silicon detectors and one position-sensitive           C2141  1   22 
           proportional counter in front of them. These           C2141  1   23 
           components are contained in a box filled with P10 gas  C2141  1   24 
           A Kapton foil of 7.5 mu-m thickness was used to        C2141  1   25 
           separate the gas filled volume of the box from the     C2141  1   26 
           vacuum of the scattering chamber.                      C2141  1   27
