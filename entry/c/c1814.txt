FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) Experiment was performed at the        C181400100011 
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at the   C181400100012 
           Michigan State University using the large-acceptance   C181400100013 
           A1900 fragment separator and the high- resolution      C181400100014 
           S800 spectrograph                                      C181400100015 
SAMPLE     The secondary beam bombarded the liquid hydrogen       C181400100016 
           target of thickness 210 mg/cm2 to induce proton        C181400100017 
           inelastic scattering. The liquid hydrogen was          C181400100018 
           contained in a cylindrical cell. The target cell had   C181400100019 
           aluminum entrance and exit windows with thicknesses    C181400100020 
           of 0.22 mm and diameters of 30 mm.The average          C181400100021 
           mid-target energy of 74Ni was 81 MeV/nucleon.          C181400100022 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction residues were analyzed with the   C181400100023 
           S800 spectrograph, whose magnetic field was set to     C181400100024 
           transmit the scattered 74Ni ions.The particle          C181400100025 
           identification was performed by combining B-rho, E-dE, C181400100026 
           and TOF measured by focal-plane detectors of the S800. C181400100027 
           (MWDC) Ion momentum was determined by two position     C181400100028 
           sensitive cathode readout drift chambers.              C181400100029 
           (TELES,IOCH,SCIN) An ionization chamber located        C181400100030 
           downstream of the drift chambers provided the dE       C181400100031 
           information. For the TOF, the flight time differences  C181400100032 
           between the target position and the final focal plane  C181400100033 
           were used, the former being extracted from the time    C181400100034 
           measured by the plastic scintillator at the exit of theC181400100035 
           A1900 and B*rho of the incident beam.                  C181400100036 
           (NAICR) The gamma rays emitted from the excited        C181400100037 
           nuclei were detected by a barrel array of NaI(Tl)      C181400100038 
           scintillators with an inner diameter of 43 cm          C181400100039 
           surrounding the liquid hydrogen target. The array      C181400100040 
           consisted of 21 NaI(Tl) scintillator bars, each of     C181400100041 
           which was 55.0 cm long and had a trapezoidal cross     C181400100042 
           section with a height of 6.0 cm and upper and lower    C181400100043 
           bases of 5.5 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. The barrel   C181400100044 
           covered a polar-angle range from 38 to 122 deg with    C181400100045 
           respect to the beam axis.                              C181400100046 
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification C181400100047 
           (COINC) Coincidence was required between 74Ni ions     C181400100048 
           detected by detectors in S800 focal plane and          C181400100049

           directed onto a 399-mg/cm2-thick 9Be fragmentation     C181400100053 
           target at a typical intensity of 20 particle nA. The   C181400100054
