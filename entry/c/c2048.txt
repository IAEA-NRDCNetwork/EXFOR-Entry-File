REACTION   (90-TH-232(P,N)91-PA-232,,SIG)                         C2048  8    3 
SAMPLE     Targets consisted of four assemblies of stacked        C2048  8    4 
           foils. The first two assemblies were considered the    C2048  8    5 
           thin targets (0.0125 mm thick). The first assembly     C2048  8    6 
           consisted of eight natural thorium foils (18.5-21.6 mg C2048  8    7 
           cm-2), and the second assembly consisted of five       C2048  8    8 
           foils. Each of the thorium foils was mounted on a      C2048  8    9 
           thin (0.025 mm) high-purity aluminum foil disk. The    C2048  8   10 
           thorium foils were 1.25 x 1.25 cm squares, whereas     C2048  8   11 
           the aluminum foil disks had a diameter of 4 cm.        C2048  8   12 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Direct analysis of the thorium foils after     C2048  8   13 
           irradiation.                                           C2048  8   14

           of the sum of squares of the errors mentioned above    C2048  8   16
