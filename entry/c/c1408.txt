INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Atomic beam polarized-ion source produced      C1408  1   12 
            unpolarized deuteron beams for measurements at three  C1408  1   13 
            separate energies: Ed = 45, 60, and 80 keV.           C1408  1   14 
            Beam currents averaged about 40 microA.               C1408  1   15 
SAMPLE     The target was made in situ in the vacuum chamber.     C1408  1   16 
           (3-LI-7,ENR=0.99) Enriched 99% 7Li was evaporated      C1408  1   17 
            directly onto the 3-mm-thick aluminum target chamber  C1408  1   18 
            face. The deposited lithium layer was thick enough to C1408  1   19 
            stop the deuteron beam and was previously determined  C1408  1   20 
            to be Li2O.                                           C1408  1   21
