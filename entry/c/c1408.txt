INC-SOURCE (POLIS) Atomic beam polarized-ion source produced      C140800100012 
            unpolarized deuteron beams for measurements at three  C140800100013 
            separate energies: Ed = 45, 60, and 80 keV.           C140800100014 
            Beam currents averaged about 40 microA.               C140800100015 
SAMPLE     The target was made in situ in the vacuum chamber.     C140800100016 
            Enriched 99% 7Li was evaporated directly onto the     C140800100017 
            3-mm-thick aluminum target chamber face. The depositedC140800100018 
            lithium layer was thick enough to stop the deuteron   C140800100019 
            beam and was previously determined to be Li2O.        C140800100020 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The emitted neutrons were detected using six    C140800100021 
            12.7-cm diameter and three 11.4-cm-diameter organic   C140800100022
