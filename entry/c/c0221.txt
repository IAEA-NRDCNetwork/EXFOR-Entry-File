SAMPLE     Targets consisting of three plastic scintillators      C0221  1   10 
           mounted behind a nuclear emulsion.                     C0221  1   11 
METHOD     (ACTIV) A plastic scintillator was sandwiched between  C0221  1   12 
           two photographic emulsions and exposed to the          C0221  1   13 
           internal proton beam. The number of C11 nuclei was     C0221  1   14 
           measured by counting beta activity in the              C0221  1   15 
           scintillator, and the number of incident protons was   C0221  1   16 
           determined by counting tracks in the emulsion.         C0221  1   17 
DETECTOR   (SCIN,TRD) Proton flux was measured by counting        C0221  1   18 
           tracks in emulsions.                                   C0221  1   19
