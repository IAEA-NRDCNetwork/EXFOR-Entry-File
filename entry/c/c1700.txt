           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory          C170000100010 
SAMPLE     9Be target with thickness of 1 mm (185 mg/cm2)         C170000100011 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)Knockout residues were momentum analyzed by     C170000100012 
           the S800 spectrograph.                                 C170000100013

           (DRFTC)Two cathode readout drift chambers measured     C170000100017 
           the position and scattering angle in both the          C170000100018 
           dispersive and nondispersive directions, and these     C170000100019 
           measurements were connected to the kinematics at the   C170000100020 
           target using ray-tracing through the magnetic field    C170000100021 
           of the S800. This allowed for the determination of     C170000100022 
           the momentum along the beam axis and the reaction      C170000100023 
           angle at the target.                                   C170000100024 
           (HPGE) The Segmented Germanium Array, an array of 32-  C170000100025 
           fold segmented high purity germanium detectors,        C170000100026 
           detected gamma rays emitted from the recoiling         C170000100027 
           nucleus after the knockout reaction.                   C170000100028 
METHOD     (COINC)Particle-gamma coincidences provided data       C170000100029

           the final nucleus.                                     C170000100031 
CORRECTION Gamma-ray spectra were Doppler corrected using the     C170000100032 
           segmentation of the detector by identifying the        C170000100033 
           segment in which the most energy was deposited as      C170000100034 
           the first interaction point.                           C170000100035 
INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 32Al was produced by               C170000100036 
           fragmentation of a 140 MeV/nucleon primary beam of     C170000100037 
           48Ca on a 806 mg/cm2 thick 9Be target. The resulting   C170000100038 
           fragments were separated using the A1900 mass          C170000100039 
           separator with a momentum acceptance of 0.5%. The      C170000100040 
           secondary beam particles were identified by their      C170000100041 
           time of flight from the extended focal plane of        C170000100042 
           the A1900 to the object box of the S800 spectrograph.  C170000100043 
           The cocktail beam was 71% pure 32Al with the           C170000100044 
           remainder being 33Si. The fully-stripped secondary     C170000100045 
           beam emerged from the magnetic separator with an       C170000100046 
           energy of 91 MeV/nucleon                               C170000100047
