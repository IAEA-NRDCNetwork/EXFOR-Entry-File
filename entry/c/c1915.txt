SAMPLE     Copper foils (~30 mg/cm2) were sandwiched between pure C1915  1   14 
           aluminum foils.                                        C1915  1   15 
METHOD     (CHSEP,BSPEC,STTA,ACTIV) The chemical elements were    C1915  1   16 
           isolated and purified by relatively standard           C1915  1   17 
           radiochemical carrier techniques. The radiochemically  C1915  1   18 
           purified elements were measured with thin-window beta  C1915  1   19 
           proportional counters. The results of the              C1915  1   20 
           computational treatment of the radioactivity data      C1915  1   21 
           were converted to relative production rates of the     C1915  1   22 
           nuclides under standard conditions by correcting for   C1915  1   23 
           losses during the chemical purifications, for the      C1915  1   24 
           efficiencies of detection of the radiations, and for   C1915  1   25 
           the growth and decay during and after the              C1915  1   26 
           irradiations. Monitoring of these irradiations was     C1915  1   27 
           achieved by "sandwiching" the copper foils between     C1915  1   28 
           pure aluminum foils, and using the production of 22Na  C1915  1   29 
           in the aluminum as a measure of proton intensities.    C1915  1   30

ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The radioactivity of each sample was followed  C1915  1   33 
           as long as practical. The results were analyzed by     C1915  1   34 
           least-squares techniques using known values of the     C1915  1   35 
           half-lives. The final proton-induced cross section     C1915  1   36 
           data are the averages of the results from two          C1915  1   37 
           irradiations.                                          C1915  1   38
