FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was conducted at the    C2354  1    9 
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)   C2354  1   10

SAMPLE     9Be reaction target with a thickness of 188-mg/cm2     C2354  1   12 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) The rare-isotope projectile beam impinging      C2354  1   13 
           onto the target was characterized using two plastic    C2354  1   14 
           timing scintillators.One was placed at the exit of     C2354  1   15 
           the A1900 fragment separator and the other at the      C2354  1   16 
           object of the S800 spectrograph, approximately 30m     C2354  1   17 
           apart. These detectors yield time-of-flight            C2354  1   18 
           information as well as the incoming beam intensity     C2354  1   19 
           and transmission efficiency.                           C2354  1   20 
           (MAGSP) The projectile-like neutron-removal residues   C2354  1   21 
           were identified and characterized with the             C2354  1   22 
           spectrograph S800.                                     C2354  1   23 
           (DRFTC) The focal plane of the S800 was equipped with  C2354  1   24 
           two cathode readout drift chambers (CRDCs) for x-y     C2354  1   25 
           position determination of the beam.                    C2354  1   26 
           (IOCH) Ionization chamber located in the focal plne    C2354  1   27 
           was used for energy-loss measurements,                 C2354  1   28 
           (SCIN) A plastic scintillator located at the focal     C2354  1   29 
           plane served as trigger and time-of-flight reference   C2354  1   30 
           relative to two plastic beam line scintillators.       C2354  1   31
