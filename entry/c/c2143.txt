DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analysed in    C2143  1   18 
           S800 high-resolution magnetic spectrograph. Reaction   C2143  1   19 
           residues were identified by detectors located in the   C2143  1   20 
           spectrometer focal plane                               C2143  1   21 
           (IOCH,SCIN) Reaction residues were identified by an    C2143  1   22 
           energy-loss measurement in an ionization chamber and   C2143  1   23 
           time of flight measurement using one plastic           C2143  1   24 
           scintillator before the target and one in the focal    C2143  1   25 
           plane.                                                 C2143  1   26

INC-SOURCE The 28Mg beam was produced by fragmentation of an      C2143  1   28 
           40Ar primary beam with an energy of 140 MeV/A on a     C2143  1   29 
           846 mg/cm2 9Be production target. The desired          C2143  1   30 
           fragment with an energy of 93 MeV/u was selected with  C2143  1   31 
           the A1900 fragment separator and impinged on a         C2143  1   32 
           9mg/cm2 9Be secondary target at the target position    C2143  1   33 
           of the S800 high-resolution magnetic                   C2143  1   34 
           spectrograph.Incoming beam particles were identified   C2143  1   35 
           event by event by their time of flight between two     C2143  1   36 
           plastic scintillators before the target. The average   C2143  1   37 
           rate on target was 5E+5 28Mg/s. The largest            C2143  1   38 
           contaminant, 29Al, amounted to only 1.5% of the total  C2143  1   39 
           beam intensity.                                        C2143  1   40
