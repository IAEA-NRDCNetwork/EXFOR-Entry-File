FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment was performed using ISAC-   C2580  1   10 
           1/DRAGON facility at TRIUMF                            C2580  1   11 
SAMPLE     Windowless gas target filled with He gas at a pressure C2580  1   12 
           of 10.6-11.1 mbar. The effective length of the target  C2580  1   13 
           was (12.3+-0.5)cm.                                     C2580  1   14 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Selected reaction recoils (23Na) were          C2580  1   15 
           transported through DRAGON recoil separator,           C2580  1   16 
           consisting of two magnetic dipoles and two             C2580  1   17 
           electrostatic dipoles complemented with focusing       C2580  1   18 
           elements.                                              C2580  1   19 
           (BGO) Windowless gas target is surrounded by a 4PI     C2580  1   20 
           gamma detector array, consisting of 30 BGO             C2580  1   21 
           scintillation detectors. Total solid angle coverage    C2580  1   22 
           of the array was 92%.                                  C2580  1   23 
           (MCPLT) A pair microchannel plate detectors were used  C2580  1   24

           (SISD) A double-sided silicon strip detector placed    C2580  1   27 
           in the DRAGON focal plane where the recoils were       C2580  1   28 
           stopped and their kinetic energy measured.             C2580  1   29 
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used                            C2580  1   30

           and recoils detected in DRAGON focal plane detectors   C2580  1   32 
           was required.                                          C2580  1   33
