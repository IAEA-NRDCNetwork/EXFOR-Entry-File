DETECTOR   (SI,SISD) Three side-by-side double-sided silicon-     C302200100026 
           strip detectors (DSSDs). To allow for cross-section    C302200100027 
           calculations, two silicon pindiode detectors were      C302200100028 
           positioned at angles of +-27.2(1) degree directly      C302200100029 
           from the beam direction. These detectors monitor the   C302200100030 
           integral of beam intensity times target thickness      C302200100031 
           through the detection of Rutherford-scattered beam     C302200100032 
           particles.                                             C302200100033 
SAMPLE     The target composed of four arc-shaped segments        C302200100034 
           forming a rotating target wheel with a diameter of     C302200100035 
           12.2 cm. A fast-acting beam chopper can interrupt the  C302200100036 
           beam in case of system failures, protecting the        C302200100037 
           target. Each target segment consisted of a 2.1(1)      C302200100038 
           mu-m thick natTi backing foil onto which 244Pu         C302200100039 
           had been electrodeposited. The electrodeposition was   C302200100040 
           performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.   C302200100041 
           The beam first passed through the Ti foil before       C302200100042 
           entering the 244Pu layer. Prior to irradiation, the    C302200100043 
           target foils were measured to have an average target   C302200100044 
           thicknesses of 0.435(40) mg/cm2 244Pu (as 244PuO2)     C302200100045 
           through gamma-ray analysis of the decay of the         C302200100046 
           short-lived 240mNp, which is part of the decay path    C302200100047 
           originating from 244Pu.                                C302200100048 
METHOD     The targets were irradiated for a total of 22.1 days   C302200100049 
           with an average center-of-target center-of-mass frame  C302200100050 
           energy of 220(3) MeV, which corresponds to an average  C302200100051 
           compound-nucleus excitation energy of 41(2) MeV        C302200100052 
           according to the Thomas-Fermi mass tables. During      C302200100053 
           these measurements, the recoiling evaporation          C302200100054 
           residues (EVRs) were separated from the beam and       C302200100055 
           unwanted nuclear reaction products in the BGS based    C302200100056 
           on their differing magnetic rigidities (Bro) in 0.45-  C302200100057 
           Torr He. At the Berkeley Gas-filled Separator (BGS)    C302200100058 
           focal plane, the EVRs were implanted into the          C302200100059 
           SuperHeavy RECoil (SHREC) detector. This detector is   C302200100060 
           comprised of three side-by-side double-sided silicon-  C302200100061 
           strip detectors (DSSDs).                               C302200100062 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-S) The error represents statistical (counting)    C302200100063 
           errors only.                                           C302200100064 
           (ERR-SYS) There is also systematic error on the cross  C302200100065 
           section, which results in an additional 12%            C302200100066 
           systematic uncertainty in the measured cross sections. C302200100067
