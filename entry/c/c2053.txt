           435 mg/cm2                                             C205300100016 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP)14Be reaction products were deflected by a      C205300100017 
           large-gap dipole magnet set to a magnetic rigidity of  C205300100018 
           3.55 Tm.                                               C205300100019 
           (DRFTC) Two cathode readout drift chambers with        C205300100020 
           dimensions of 30cm x 30 cm separated by 1.88 m was     C205300100021 
           used to determine position and angle of charged        C205300100022 
           particles.                                             C205300100023 
           (SCIN) Energy loss and total energy of charged         C205300100024 
           particles were measured in 5 mm and 150 mm thick       C205300100025 
           plastic  scintillators, respectively.                  C205300100026 
           (SCIN) Coincident neutrons were measured with the      C205300100027 
           Modular Neutron Array. The 144 plastic scintillator    C205300100028 
           detectors of the array were arranged into 18 walls     C205300100029 
           each 80 cm tall. The walls were assembled into two     C205300100030 
           close-packed blocks located at 0deg and 23deg from     C205300100031 
           the secondary beam direction, with their respective    C205300100032 
           distances from the target being 650 cm and 470 cm.     C205300100033 
METHOD     (COINC,EDE)                                            C205300100034 
INC-SOURCE A 120 MeV/u 18-O primary beam from the Coupled         C205300100035 
           Cyclotron Facility bombarded a 3196 mg/cm2             C205300100036 
           9Be production target. The A1900 fragment separator    C205300100037 
           in conjunction with a 1050 mg/cm2 aluminum achromatic  C205300100038 
           wedge degrader was used to separate and select for     C205300100039 
           the 14Be secondary beam. The final energy of the beam  C205300100040 
           was 59 MeV/u with a momentum spread of 2%, an          C205300100041 
           intensity of approximately 1000 pps, and a purity of   C205300100042 
           96.5%.                                                 C205300100043 
ANALYSIS   The energy and momentum vector of the fragments were   C205300100044 
           reconstructed from a transformation matrix based on    C205300100045 
           the magnetic field map.                                C205300100046
