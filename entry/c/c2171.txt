SAMPLE     Sodium-fluoride targets were prepared by vacuum        C2171  9    4 
           evaporation of reagent grade NaF from a nickel         C2171  9    5

           aluminum foil. A layer of shellac =0.1 mg/cm2 was      C2171  9    7 
           first sprayed over the backing foil to prevent Raking  C2171  9    8 
           of the salt during subsequent handling.  The           C2171  9    9 
           evaporation was carried out slowly in both cases to    C2171  9   10

SAMPLE     Arsenic targets of =10 mg/cm2 were prepared in a       C2171 11    4 
           similar manner as NaF from purified crystalline        C2171 11    5 
           metal. The evaporation was carried out slowly in both  C2171 11    6 
           cases to prevent cracking of the evaporated layer.     C2171 11    7 
           Punched circles about 1.4 cm in diameter were weighed  C2171 11    8 
           individually and stacked between aluminum spacers of   C2171 11    9 
           5 mg/cm2 for As for the excitation function runs.      C2171 11   10 
METHOD     (STTA,ACTIV,CHSEP) A stack of 16 arsenic foils         C2171 11   11 
           separated by aluminum spacers was bombarded for 20     C2171 11   12 
           min at 0.05 pA with 15.4-MeV deuterons. The arsenic    C2171 11   13 
           was dissolved off the aluminum backing with H202 and   C2171 11   14 
           NH4OH. The individual foil measurement was used for    C2171 11   15 
           cross sections normalization.                          C2171 11   16
