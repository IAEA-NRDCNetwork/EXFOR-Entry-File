           HECTOR, the High Efficiency TOtal absorption           C3053001   16 
           spectrometeR. HECTOR is a NaI(Tl) array comprised of   C3053001   17 
           16 segments providing a nearly 4pi solid angle         C3053001   18

SAMPLE     (40-ZR-90,ENR=0.98) An enriched (98(1)%) target of     C3053001   20 
           90Zr, with a thickness of 969(48) microg/cm2. The      C3053001   21 
           energy spread of the beam from the accelerator is      C3053001   22 
           about 5 keV, the energy loss in the target ranged      C3053001   23 
           from 34 to 66 keV for the highest and lowest beam      C3053001   24 
           energy utilized, respectively.                         C3053001   25 
METHOD     The gamma rays from the deexcitation cascade           C3053001   26 
           following the proton capture were detected in HECTOR.  C3053001   27 
           The excited state populated via the proton capture is  C3053001   28 
           well defined and given by: Ex = Ecm + Q, where Ecm is  C3053001   29 
           the total kinetic energy in the center of mass frame   C3053001   30 
           and Q = 5.154 MeV is the reaction Q-value. Thus, the   C3053001   31 
           total energy carried by the gamma rays in the          C3053001   32 
           deexcitation cascade is ES = Ex. The events where the  C3053001   33 
           whole cascade is absorbed by the detector form the     C3053001   34 
           sum peak, a peak corresponding to the ES energy. In    C3053001   35 
           such case, the capture cross section for the reaction  C3053001   36 
           of interest can be obtained from: sigma =              C3053001   37 
           NS/(Nt*Nb*epsilon), where NS is the number of counts   C3053001   38 
           within the sum peak, Nt is the target areal density,   C3053001   39 
           Nb is the number of beam particles impinged on the     C3053001   40 
           target and epsilon is the summing efficiency.          C3053001   41

ANALYSIS   For each beam energy, the sum peak is fitted with a    C3053002    4 
           combination of a Gaussian peak and a linear            C3053002    5 
           background to account for incomplete summation         C3053002    6 
           events. Then the linear background is subtracted from  C3053002    7 
           the sum-peak and the resulting spectrum is integrated  C3053002    8 
           within +-3 sigma range around the centroid of the      C3053002    9 
           sum-peak. The summing efficiency was determined using  C3053002   10 
           Geant4 simulations. gamma-ray cascades corresponding   C3053002   11 
           to a total energy equal to ES were used to model the   C3053002   12 
           detector response. A combination of cascades with      C3053002   13 
           varying number of gamma rays was used in each          C3053002   14 
           simulation.                                            C3053002   15

           efficiency simulations. The relative uncertainty of    C3053002   18 
           the simulated efficiency is 10-12%. The beam current   C3053002   19

ANALYSIS   The experimental results of this work were used to     C3053003    4 
           determine the best theoretical description of          C3053003    5 
           reaction cross section for 90Zr(p,gamma)91Nb using     C3053003    6 
           the Hauser-Feshbach (HF) formalism. Talys 1.9 code     C3053003    7 
           was used to explore combination of various models      C3053003    8 
           for level density (LD) and gamma-ray strength function C3053003    9 
            (gSF) to calculate the reaction cross section. The    C3053003   10 
           best model from Talys was then used to calculate the   C3053003   11 
           reaction rate for 90Zr(p,gamma)91Nb.                   C3053003   12
