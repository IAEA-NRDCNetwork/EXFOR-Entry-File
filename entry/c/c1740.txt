FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment preformed at the ISAC I     C174000100012 
           facility using TUDA detector array. Radioactive 18F    C174000100013 
           beam was accelerated using RFQ/Linac of the ISAC 1     C174000100014 
           facility.                                              C174000100015 
SAMPLE     Polyethylene (CH2)n target with thickness of (31.6 +-  C174000100016

DETECTOR   (SISD) Reaction products were detected by two          C174000100018 
           silicon strip detectors (LEDA) and two double sided    C174000100019 
           silicon strip detectors (S2)                           C174000100020 
           (SI) Measurement of scattered beam particles was       C174000100021 
           achieved using a DE-E monolithic detector and a        C174000100022 
           2mu-m aluminium shielded silicon photodiode. From      C174000100023 
           this measurement beam intensity and beam               C174000100024 
           purity  (i.e. 18-F/18-O ratio) was determined.         C174000100025 
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) Reaction products identified combination of  C174000100026 
           time of flight and E-dE methods.                       C174000100027 
           (COINC) The products of the 18F(p,a)15-O reaction      C174000100028 
           were detected in coincidence                           C174000100029 
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Production of the 18F radioactive beam was     C174000100030 
           achieved using the ISOL method. An accelerated 500     C174000100031 
           MeV beam of protons from the main cyclotron were       C174000100032 
           directed onto a high power silicon carbide target to   C174000100033 
           produce the 18F, which was then extracted and ionised  C174000100034 
           using a FEBIAD ion source. The extracted beam was      C174000100035 
           further accelerated to a pre-separator and then the    C174000100036 
           mass separator where the 18F and isobaric elements wereC174000100037 
           selected. From here the beam was post accelerated to   C174000100038 
           the TUDA.                                              C174000100039
