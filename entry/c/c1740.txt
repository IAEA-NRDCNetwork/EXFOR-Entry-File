FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment performed at the ISAC I     C1740  1   11 
           facility using TUDA detector array. Radioactive 18F    C1740  1   12 
           beam was accelerated using RFQ/Linac of the ISAC 1     C1740  1   13 
           facility.                                              C1740  1   14 
SAMPLE     Polyethylene (CH2)n target with thickness of (31.6 +-  C1740  1   15 
           1.9)mu-g/cm2                                           C1740  1   16 
DETECTOR   (SISD) Reaction products were detected by two          C1740  1   17 
           silicon strip detectors (LEDA) and two double sided    C1740  1   18 
           silicon strip detectors (S2)                           C1740  1   19 
           (SI) Measurement of scattered beam particles was       C1740  1   20 
           achieved using a DE-E monolithic detector and a        C1740  1   21 
           2mu-m aluminium shielded silicon photodiode. From      C1740  1   22 
           this measurement beam intensity and beam               C1740  1   23 
           purity  (i.e. 18-F/18-O ratio) was determined.         C1740  1   24 
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) Reaction products identified combination of  C1740  1   25 
           time of flight and E-dE methods.                       C1740  1   26 
           (COINC) The products of the 18F(p,a)15-O reaction      C1740  1   27 
           were detected in coincidence                           C1740  1   28 
INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Production of the 18F radioactive beam was     C1740  1   29 
           achieved using the ISOL method. An accelerated 500     C1740  1   30 
           MeV beam of protons from the main cyclotron were       C1740  1   31 
           directed onto a high power silicon carbide target to   C1740  1   32 
           produce the 18F, which was then extracted and ionised  C1740  1   33 
           using a FEBIAD ion source. The extracted beam was      C1740  1   34 
           further accelerated to a pre-separator and then the    C1740  1   35 
           mass separator where the 18F and isobaric elements wereC1740  1   36 
           selected. From here the beam was post accelerated to   C1740  1   37 
           the TUDA.                                              C1740  1   38
