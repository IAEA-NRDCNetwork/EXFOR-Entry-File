FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USABRK) The Crocker Laboratory 60-inch         C2319  1    9 
           cyclotron.                                             C2319  1   10 
SAMPLE     The amount of Bk249 available was only 1.2x10**-8 g,   C2319  1   11 
           or about 3x10**13 atoms. The target material was       C2319  1   12 
           deposited as a very thin layer over a rectangular      C2319  1   13 
           area 0.6x6 mm on a 0.005-cm-thick gold foil. (This     C2319  1   14 
           small target area was chosen to match the area of the  C2319  1   15 
           most intense helium-ion beam.)                         C2319  1   16 
DETECTOR   (PROPC) A windowless proportional counter was assumed  C2319  1   17 
           to give a counting efficiency of 90% for the           C2319  1   18 
           beta-particles from Bk249 mounted on thick platinum    C2319  1   19 
           plates.                                                C2319  1   20 
METHOD     (REC,CHSEP,ACTIV) The beam passed first through the    C2319  1   21 
           gold foil and then through the Bk249 target, so that   C2319  1   22 
           nuclear reaction products were ejected from the        C2319  1   23 
           target in the forward direction. They were caught on   C2319  1   24 
           a 0.00025-cm thick gold "catcher" foil placed about    C2319  1   25 
           5.5 mm from the target foil. By this method it was     C2319  1   26 
           possible to bombard the Bk249 target a large number    C2319  1   27 
           of times without the necessity of dissolving it. Some  C2319  1   28 
           45 bombardments, many of them for as long as 9 hours,  C2319  1   29 
           were made with no loss of target material. The Bk249   C2319  1   30 
           target also contained a known amount of Cm244 from     C2319  1   31 
           which Cf246 was produced by the (alpha,2n) reaction.   C2319  1   32

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The accuracy of the cross-section           C2319  1   35 
           measurements was limited to about 30% by (1)           C2319  1   36 
           uncertainty in the amount of Bk249 in the target (the  C2319  1   37 
           very soft beta- activity of Bk249 is not easy to       C2319  1   38 
           count accurately, since the counting yield is very     C2319  1   39

           based only on alpha-pulse analysis, not taking into    C2319  2    8

COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Authors suggest that Es250 also    C2319  5    4 
           can be produced due to decay of Bk249 to Cf249,        C2319  5    5 
           T1/2=280 days, modern values 330 days. Multiple        C2319  5    6 
           reactions/decays on Cf249 could lead to Es250;         C2319  5    7 
           however, half-life value of Bk249 makes these          C2319  5    8 
           contributions small.                                   C2319  5    9
