INC-SOURCE (KINDT) The proton-rich nucleus 36Ca with t1/2 = 102   C193300100033 
           ms was produced by fragmenting a 140 MeV/nucleon 40Ca  C193300100034 
           primary beam on a 9Be target and was filtered using    C193300100035 
           the A1900 fragment separator. The 36Ca purity was 8%,  C193300100036 
           and other beam constituents included 35K, 34Ar, 33Cl,  C193300100037 
           and 32S.                                               C193300100038 
ANALYSIS   Cross section was determined from several experimental C193300100039 
           runs, the RMS deviation between individual runs was    C193300100040 
           0.7 mb i.e. 14%.                                       C193300100041
