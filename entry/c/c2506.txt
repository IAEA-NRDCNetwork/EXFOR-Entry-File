SAMPLE     A self-supporting beryllium metal foil of              C2506  1    9 
           9.1 mg/cm2 thickness.                                  C2506  1   10 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Two 5.1 x 3.2 cm NaI crystals operated in      C2506  1   11 
           fast-slow coincidence.                                 C2506  1   12 
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,EXTB) The proton current 60 nA was        C2506  1   13 
           collected in a Faraday cup. The beam was pulsed:       C2506  1   14 
           0.7 sec irradiation interval, a 10.0 sec counting      C2506  1   15 
           interval. The target was mounted at the center of an   C2506  1   16 
           annular aluminum stopper 10 cm long, and with a wall   C2506  1   17 
           thickness of 3.8 cm. Pairs of 511 keV quanta were      C2506  1   18 
           detected in two NaI crystals operated in fast-slow     C2506  1   19 
           coincidence. The coincidence resolving time of the     C2506  1   20 
           detectors was 12 nsec full width at half maximum.      C2506  1   21 
           The absolute efficiency of the apparatus as a detector C2506  1   22 
           of B-8 positrons was obtained in two stages: (i) The   C2506  1   23 
           distribution of the stopped positrons in the aluminum  C2506  1   24 
           stopper was calculated; and (ii) a Na-22 source of     C2506  1   25 
           known strength was used to measure experimentally the  C2506  1   26 
           efficiency.                                            C2506  1   27 
CORRECTION Correction was made:                                   C2506  1   28 
           - to take into account those B-8 nuclei which recoil   C2506  1   29 
             out of the target at angles such as to be lost; this C2506  1   30 
             correction is approximately 4% at Ep = 30 MeV and    C2506  1   31 
             12% at Ep =47.5 MeV,                                 C2506  1   32 
           - for positron annihilation in flight. '               C2506  1   33 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The errors on the cross sections were          C2506  1   34 
           obtained by adding in quadrature statistical errors in C2506  1   35
