SAMPLE     As solid targets of D-compounds did not last long      C2893001   11 
           under bombardment, we used liquid D3PO4 for longer     C2893001   12 
           series of measurements, which proved to be very        C2893001   13 
           satisfactory.                                          C2893001   14

METHOD     The protons produced in the D-D reaction penetrate     C2893001   16 
           thin aluminum windows and are counted by means of an   C2893001   17 
           ionization chamber, linear amplifier and a             C2893001   18 
           scale-of-eight thyratron counter. The neutrons are     C2893001   19 
           recorded with the same apparatus, by the use of a      C2893001   20 
           paraffin lined chamber for the fast neutrons, a        C2893001   21 
           boron-lined chamber for slow neutrons, or a simple     C2893001   22 
           air chamber (for calculating absolute values) . The    C2893001   23 
           yield of the neutrons was compared with that of        C2893001   24 
           neutrons from a 15 mg radium-beryllium source          C2893001   25 
           replacing the target.                                  C2893001   26 
ANALYSIS   The total number of protons produced in D3PO4,         C2893001   27 
           measured at 90 degrees from the direction of the ion   C2893001   28 
           beam, is 7x10**4 /sec at 100 keV and 1 microA on the   C2893001   29 
           assumption of isotropic emission in all directions.    C2893001   30 
           Actually appreciably more neutrons were found in the   C2893001   31 
           direction of the beam than at 90 degrees. Multiplying  C2893001   32 
           the yield by 50/3, the ratio of the number of          C2893001   33 
           electrons in D3PO4 and the number of D-atoms, one      C2893001   34 
           gets as yield for the D-D reaction 1 proton for        C2893001   35 
           6x10**6 impinging deuterons.                           C2893001   36 
ERR-ANALYS Solid targets -(ND4) 2SO4, ND4C1, KOD - give within    C2893001   37 
           20% the same yield after correcting for the stopping   C2893001   38 
           power in the same way as for the D3PO4 target.         C2893001   39
