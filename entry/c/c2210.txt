FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed using coupled     C2210  1   12 
           cyclotrons of the National Superconducting Cyclotron   C2210  1   13 
           Laboratory at Michigan State University.               C2210  1   14 
SAMPLE     The secondary tin beams impinged on a 47 mg/cm2 9Be    C2210  1   15 
           reaction target at the target position of the S800     C2210  1   16 
           magnetic spectrometer                                  C2210  1   17 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The reaction residues were momentum analysed   C2210  1   18 
           using S800 magnetic spectrometer.                      C2210  1   19 
           (DRFTC) Two cathode readout drift chambers measured    C2210  1   20 
           the particle positions and angles in the focal plane.  C2210  1   21 
           These were used to reconstruct momentum distributions  C2210  1   22 
           of the reaction residues.                              C2210  1   23 
           (CSICR) The secondary target was surrounded by the     C2210  1   24 
           high-efficiency CsI(Na) scintillator array (CAESAR)    C2210  1   25 
           that was used to identify the decay gamma rays of the  C2210  1   26 
           reaction products. CAESAR consists of 192 CsI(Na)      C2210  1   27 
           crystals with 95% of solid-angle coverage. The         C2210  1   28 
           granularity of the array enables event-by-event        C2210  1   29 
           Doppler reconstruction of gamma rays emitted in-flight.C2210  1   30 
           (SCIN,IOCH) The reaction residues were identified      C2210  1   31 
           event by event by using the time of flight between     C2210  1   32 
           two plastic scintillators and the energy loss dE       C2210  1   33 
           measured in the S800 focal-plane ion chamber.          C2210  1   34 
METHOD     (COINC,EDE,TOF) Particle energy determination for EdE  C2210  1   35 
           method was made using time of flight                   C2210  1   36 
INC-SOURCE Primary 124Xe beam was accelerated to 140 MeV/A. Two   C2210  1   37 
           settings of the A1900 fragment separator were used to  C2210  1   38 
           select 108Sn and 106Sn secondary beams and to deliver  C2210  1   39 
           them to the target position of the S800 spectrograph.  C2210  1   40 
           The average rate of 108Sn on the reaction target       C2210  1   41 
           was 3000 pps.                                          C2210  1   42
