           Mean proton energies within a target stack was         C2147  1   49

           assuming that the excitation function for those        C2147  1   51 
           isotopes is well known. The beam current was chosen    C2147  1   52 
           conservatively and had an average of 18.50+-0.02 mu-A. C2147  1   53 
METHOD     (ACTIV,CHSEP) WO3 mass was weighed and dissolved in    C2147  1   54

           Rhenium isotopes were quantitatively retained, while   C2147  1   61 
           the Na2WO4 matrix solution eluted. This final product  C2147  1   62 
           was assayed for W, Ta, Hf and Re concentration via     C2147  1   63 
           ICP-AES. An aliquot (2.29 g of solution out of 20.0 g  C2147  1   64 
           total mass) was diluted with HCl (up to a              C2147  1   65 
           total of 5.0 g, 0.1 mol dm-3) for analyses.            C2147  1   66 
           Raw instrument results were corrected for dilution     C2147  1   67 
           and total target mass. Final product activities        C2147  1   68 
           measured by gamma ray spectroscopy.                    C2147  1   69
