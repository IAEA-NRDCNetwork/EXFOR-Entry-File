ANALYSIS   The total cross section for the fission reaction was   C2605  2    4 
           estimated from the area under the fission part of      C2605  2    5 
           the mass yield curve. This value must be considered to C2605  2    6 
           be a very rough one, because of the unknown intensity  C2605  2    7 
           of the helium ion beam.                                C2605  2    8

METHOD     (EXTB,CHSEP) After each of the irradiations,           C2605  3    5 
           amounting to some 25 in number, the metallic uranium   C2605  3    6 
           was dissolved, and the yield in weighed chemical       C2605  3    7 
           reactions of each of several isotopes was determined   C2605  3    8 
           by means of counting experiments using a               C2605  3    9 
           Geiger-Mueller counter. The yield for each isotope     C2605  3   10 
           was determined relative to a standard isotope, the     C2605  3   11 
           12.8-day Ba140, in order to compensate for the         C2605  3   12 
           day-to-day variation in intensity of the helium ion    C2605  3   13

CORRECTION Corrections were made for self-absorption, and for     C2605  3   15 
           absorption by air and the mica window;                 C2605  3   16 
           back-scattering was insignificant in comparison with   C2605  3   17 
           other factors.                                         C2605  3   18 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors indicated on this curve are      C2605  3   19
