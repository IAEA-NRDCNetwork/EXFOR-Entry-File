SAMPLE     Target consisted of set of four 208Pb foils, backed by C2567  1   10 
           Al foils. Stacked target thicknesses were 0.585, 0.856,C2567  1   11

           The Al foil thicknesses were 5.033 and 0.98mg/cm2.     C2567  1   13

DETECTOR   (SI) Each Pb target-degrader assembly was at the       C2567  1   17 
           center of a cubical vacuum chamber, where four         C2567  1   18

           production targets. Beams of radioactive 11Li were     C2567  1   23 
           extracted with energies up to 18.4 keV,                C2567  1   24 
           mass-separated by passage through two dipole magnets,  C2567  1   25

           radio-frequency quadrupole and drift tube linear       C2567  1   27 
           accelerators. The "center-of-target" 11Li beam energiesC2567  1   28 
           were 26.1, 27.4, 28.5 and 32.7MeV in the four cubes    C2567  1   29 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 11Li beam was pulsed on for less than 5    C2567  1   30 
           ns and shut off for 172 ns, during which time the      C2567  1   31 
           alpha decay of any stopped evaporation residue was     C2567  1   32 
           measured. Product nuclei were identified by alpha      C2567  1   33

ANALYSIS   There is an ambiguity in the identification of 212mAt, C2567  2    5 
           215At, and 216mAt based on alpha spectroscopy alone.   C2567  2    6 
           HIVAP and similar calculations predict very small      C2567  2    7 
           cross section for complete fusion product 216At. For   C2567  2    8 
           negligibly small production cross section 216At was    C2567  2    9 
           removed from the 212Atm/215At ambiguity.               C2567  2   10
