DETECTOR   (NAICR,GEMUC) 3- x 3-in. NaI crystal.                  C2317  1   12 
METHOD     (CHSEP,ACTIV) After irradiation, the targets were      C2317  1   13 
           dissolved in HCl; yttrium, strontium, and barium       C2317  1   14 
           carriers were added and the solution was made          C2317  1   15 
           strongly basic with NaOH to remove aluminum. After     C2317  1   16 
           washing, the precipitate was dissolved in a small      C2317  1   17 
           amount of concentrated HNO3, strontium and barium      C2317  1   18 
           carriers were again added and then precipitated as     C2317  1   19 
           nitrates with fuming nitric acid. The prepared         C2317  1   20 
           samples were gamma counted as soon as possible flat    C2317  1   21 
           against the aluminum shield of a NaI scintillation     C2317  1   22 
           crystal. After a period of ten half-lives ( 32 h),     C2317  1   23 
           the samples were beta counted with a lead shielded     C2317  1   24 
           calibrated Geiger-Muller counter.                      C2317  1   25
