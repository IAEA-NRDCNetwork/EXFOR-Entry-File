SAMPLE     Polyethylene foil (CD2)n with thickness of 80 mu-g/cm2 C195300100017 
           The target surface was placed at 30deg with respect to C195300100018 
           the beam axis, so the effective areal density was      C195300100019 
           160 mu-g/cm2. Inverse kinematics was used.             C195300100020 
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SISD) The ORRUBA array consisted of ten      C195300100021 
           1000 mu-m thick position sensitive silicon strip       C195300100022 
           detectors, plus four thinner dE detectors that were    C195300100023 
           used to form detector telescopes for the more forward  C195300100024 
           angles                                                 C195300100025 
           (SISD,MCPLT) Annular silicon strip detector, a carbon- C195300100026 
           foil-microchannel plate detector, and a                C195300100027 
           segmented-anode ion counter were placed at forward     C195300100028 
           angle and used for beam diagnostic.                    C195300100029 
METHOD     (EDE) E-dE method was used for particle identification.C195300100030

           Inverse kinematics was used                            C195300100035 
ANALYSIS   Cross section normalization was achieved by detecting  C195300100036 
           elastically scattered deuterons with the ORRUBA at     C195300100037 
           relatively small center-of-mass angles                 C195300100038 
            33deg-38deg, where the ratio to Rutherford            C195300100039 
           scattering is in the range 0.92 - 0.99, and comparing  C195300100040
