SAMPLE     Thick targets (about 0.125 in. in thickness) of the    C1072  1    9 
           elements to be investigated in the form of             C1072  1   10 
           self-supporting disks 4 in. in diameter. The disks     C1072  1   11 
            (up to 18 elements at one time) were attached to a    C1072  1   12 
           light Al frame; each target material could be lowered  C1072  1   13 
           into the beam position under vacuum. The whole target  C1072  1   14 
           assembly was fashioned from thin-walled Al pipe in an  C1072  1   15 
           effort to minimize the effects of neutron              C1072  1   16 
           interactions in the region around the targets.         C1072  1   17 
DETECTOR   (LONGC) Neutrons produced in the (p,n) reaction were   C1072  1   18 
           detected by a long counter set at a distance of 30.25  C1072  1   19 
           in. from the target position. The efficiency of the    C1072  1   20 
           long counter was calibrated by use of a 252Cf neutron  C1072  1   21 
           source of known intensity.                             C1072  1   22
