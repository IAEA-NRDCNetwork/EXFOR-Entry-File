FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) Experiment performed at the Coupled    C2216  1   12 
           Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting     C2216  1   13 
           Cyclotron Laboratory                                   C2216  1   14 
SAMPLE     Vitreous carbon 12C target with thickness of           C2216  1   15 
           149.4 mg/cm2 and density of 1.54g/cm3                  C2216  1   16 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) reaction products were momentum analysed       C2216  1   17 
           using S800 spectrograph and identified on an           C2216  1   18 
           event-by-event basis in focal plane detector           C2216  1   19 
           (HPGE) Gamma ray energy tracking was performed using   C2216  1   20 
           in-beam nuclear array GRETINA. Seven highly segmented  C2216  1   21 
           GRETINA modules with 36-fold segmented crystals were   C2216  1   22 
           arranged in two rings. Four modules were located at    C2216  1   23 
           58 deg and three modules at 90 deg. Online signal      C2216  1   24 
           decomposition provided gamma-ray interaction points    C2216  1   25 
           for event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the       C2216  1   26 
           gamma rays emitted in-flight. The information on the   C2216  1   27 
           momentum vector of the projectile-like residues was    C2216  1   28 
           incorporated into the Doppler reconstruction           C2216  1   29 
METHOD     (COINC) For clean particle identification, gamma-ray   C2216  1   30 
           coincidences were required to eliminate unreacted      C2216  1   31 
           48Ca contaminating identifications made without        C2216  1   32 
           coincidences.                                          C2216  1   33 
CORRECTION Detected gamma ray energy was corrected for Doppler    C2216  1   34 
           shift taking into account also momentum of the         C2216  1   35 
           projectile-like reaction residues.                     C2216  1   36 
INC-SOURCE 48Ca primary beam was energy degraded in the A1900     C2216  1   37 
           fragment separator with a 1363mg/cm2 9Be target and    C2216  1   38 
           transmitted to the experimental vault with the         C2216  1   39
