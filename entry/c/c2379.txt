DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) 75-mm-thick x 75-mm-diam NaI(Tl)          C2379  1   13 
           scintillator.                                          C2379  1   14 
SAMPLE     The targets were 3.2-mm-thick by 38-mm-diam disks of   C2379  1   15 
           Pilots B and F plastic scintillator containing 91.6%   C2379  1   16 
           carbon by weight. These disks were the same diameter   C2379  1   17 
           as the first scintillator of the counter telescope     C2379  1   18 
           and were mounted to its upstream face during the       C2379  1   19 
           irradiations. No correction was made for the 1.11% 13C C2379  1   20 
           content of the carbon; that is, the results reported   C2379  1   21 
           here technically apply to natural carbon.              C2379  1   22 
METHOD     (ACTIV,COINC) The targets were irradiated for 20 to    C2379  1   23 
           40 min (one to two half-lives of the 11C) and were     C2379  1   24 
           then transported to a counting area where the target   C2379  1   25 
           scintillator disk was optically coupled to the face    C2379  1   26 
           of a photomultiplier tube. This assembly was then      C2379  1   27 
           placed in contact with the face of a NaI(Tl)           C2379  1   28 
           scintillator inside a lead shield. The 11C positrons   C2379  1   29 
           were self-detected by the plastic scintillator, and    C2379  1   30 
           the annihilation quanta were detected in the NaI(Tl)   C2379  1   31 
           scintillator which had an electronic window set to     C2379  1   32 
           include only the 511-keV photopeak pulses. Each        C2379  1   33 
           sample was counted for at least three half-lives with  C2379  1   34 
           standard beta-gamma coincidence circuity. The 11C      C2379  1   35 
           disintegration rate was calculated from the net beta+, C2379  1   36 
           gamma, and beta+-gamma coincidence rates.              C2379  1   37 
CORRECTION Reproducibility corrections ranged from 2% for 30-MeV  C2379  1   38 
           pi+ to 13% for 30-MeV pi-.                             C2379  1   39
