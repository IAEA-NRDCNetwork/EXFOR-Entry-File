FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the    C2773  1   13 
           National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at       C2773  1   14 
           Michigan State University using the ReAccelerator      C2773  1   15 
           facility.                                              C2773  1   16 
SAMPLE     A small gas-cell target filled with hydrogen gas. The  C2773  1   17 
           gas cell has a 2 mu-m thick molybdenum foil used for   C2773  1   18 
           the front and back cell window and is approximately 4  C2773  1   19 
           cm in length. It was filled with 600 Torr of           C2773  1   20 
           hydrogen gas for the experiment and the beam loss was  C2773  1   21 
           approximately 0.19-0.22 MeV/u, depending on the        C2773  1   22 
           initial beam energy                                    C2773  1   23 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma rays were detected with the summing      C2773  1   24 
           NaI(Tl) (SuN) detector. SuN is a cylindrical detector  C2773  1   25 
           of optically isolated NaI crystals 16 inches in        C2773  1   26 
           length and diameter with a 1.77 inch borehole in the   C2773  1   27 
           center resulting in nearly 4pi angular coverage. The   C2773  1   28 
           gas-cell target filled with hydrogen gas was placed    C2773  1   29 
           in the center of SuN.                                  C2773  1   30 
METHOD     Inverse kinematics was used                            C2773  1   31
