SAMPLE     The 1.7 mg/cm2 bismuth foil was imagined to be         C2315  1    9 
           divided, parallel to the foil faces, into a series of  C2315  1   10 
           thin sections of equal thicknesses. The target was     C2315  1   11 
           prepared by vacuum evaporation of bismuth on one side  C2315  1   12 
           of a thin (0.09 mg/cm2) gold foil.                     C2315  1   13

METHOD     (ACTIV) In order to obtain the relative cross section  C2315  1   16 
           as a function of the energy of the incident helium     C2315  1   17 
           ions for the Bi209(n,alpha)At212 reaction, bismuth     C2315  1   18 
           target on a gold backing was bombarded with an         C2315  1   19 
           energy-analyzed beam. The lab energy of the            C2315  1   20 
           bombarding beam was varied from 18.25 to 19.25 MeV.    C2315  1   21 
           The energy of the alpha particles emitted by At212     C2315  1   22 
           was measured.                                          C2315  1   23
