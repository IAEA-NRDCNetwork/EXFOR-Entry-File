FACILITY   (LASER,1USAROC) Experiment performed at OMEGA laser    C2569  1   10 
           facility. It is a 60-terawatt, 60-beam, frequency-     C2569  1   11 
           tripled Nd:glass laser system designed to perform      C2569  1   12 
           precision direct-drive inertial-confinement-fusion     C2569  1   13 
           experiments.                                           C2569  1   14 
SAMPLE     Spherical plastic shells filled with various fuel      C2569  1   15 
           mixtures. Shells were nominally 15 mu-m thick with     C2569  1   16 
           overcoating of 0.1 mu-m Al. Diameter of the shell was  C2569  1   17 
           860 mu-m. Different target fills were used. For        C2569  1   18 
           primary experiment pD fusion an equimolar mix of       C2569  1   19 
           deuterium and hydrogen fill gas with 5.33 atm of each  C2569  1   20 
           was used. For background measurements pure D2 at       C2569  1   21 
           pressure of 8 atm and pure H2 at 16 atm were used.     C2569  1   22 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Elastically scattered neutrons from dense D or  C2569  1   23 
           H was measured by time of flight technique over        C2569  1   24 
           flight path of 13.4 m with advanced liquid             C2569  1   25 
           scintillation detector.                                C2569  1   26 
           (CEREN) High energy gamma rays were detected using     C2569  1   27 
           threshold Cherenkov detector. Detector consist of      C2569  1   28 
           converter foil where high energy photons produce high  C2569  1   29 
           energy electrons which enter radiator gas CO2 cell,    C2569  1   30 
           where Cherenkov light is produced if the electron      C2569  1   31 
           exceeds the local speed of light. Cherenkov light is   C2569  1   32 
           relayed to a photomultiplier tube and the electrical   C2569  1   33 
           signal is recorded on a high-bandwidth oscilloscope.   C2569  1   34 
           The threshold depends on gas pressure. In present      C2569  1   35 
           study radiator gas pressure of 400 psi was used,       C2569  1   36 
           which resulted in threshold of 2.9 MeV.                C2569  1   37
