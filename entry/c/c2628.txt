DETECTOR   (HPGE,SCIN) A coaxial n-type HPGe detector, of 109%    C262800100012 
           relative efficiency. Additionally, a CeBr detector     C262800100013 
           was fixed at a backward angle of -135 degree in order  C262800100014 
           to provide a consistency check throughout the          C262800100015 
           experiment and monitor for any drifting.               C262800100016 
SAMPLE     Three different types of nitrogen implanted targets    C262800100017 
           with backings of Mo, Ta, and W to reduce systematic    C262800100018 
           uncertainties. The targets were produced with the 5    C262800100019 
           MV Sta. Ana accelerator at the University of Notre     C262800100020 
           Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory. The Ta, Mo, and W     C262800100021 
           targets were found to have nitrogen contents of        C262800100022 
           21.3+-1.3, 13.1+-0.7, and 13.4+-0.5*10**17 atoms/cm2,  C262800100023 
           respectively.                                          C262800100024 
METHOD     The lifetimes have been determined with the Doppler-   C262800100025 
           Shift Attenuation Method (DSAM) with three separate,   C262800100026 
           nitrogen-implanted targets with Mo, Ta, and W backing. C262800100027

ANALYSIS   Authors obtained lifetimes from the weighted average   C262800200004 
           of the three measurements, allowing us to account for  C262800200005 
           systematic differences between the backing materials.  C262800200006 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Authors indicate possible presence of       C262800200007 
           systematic uncertainties, however no details are given.C262800200008 
COMMENT    Compiler's comment: Authors provided experimentally    C262800200009 
           determined lifetime values (in fs). The compiler       C262800200010 
           used listed in the article (page 045802-2) formula:    C262800200011
