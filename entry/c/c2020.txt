           (82-PB-206,ENR=0.0030) Target consisted of set of      C2020  1   13 
           four 208Pb foils, backed by 0.54 mg/cm2 Al foils. The  C2020  1   14 
           208Pb target thicknesses were 0.859, 0.414, 0.605,     C2020  1   15 
           and 1.019 mg/cm2. The target-degrader foil assemblies  C2020  1   16 
           were tilted at 45 deg with respect to the incident     C2020  1   17

DETECTOR   (SI) Each Pb target-degrader assembly was at the       C2020  1   19 
           center of a cubical vacuum chamber, where four         C2020  1   20

           were 39.9, 36.5, 32.7, and 28.6 MeV in the four cubes  C2020  1   31 
METHOD     (ACTIV) The 11Li beam was pulsed on for less than 5    C2020  1   32 
           ns and shut off for 172 ns, during which time the      C2020  1   33

ANALYSIS   There is an ambiguity in the identification of 212mAt, C2020  2    6 
           215At, and 216mAt based on alpha spectroscopy alone.   C2020  2    7 
           HIVAP and similar calculations predict very small      C2020  2    8 
           cross section for complete fusion product 216At. For   C2020  2    9 
           negligibly small production cross section 216At was    C2020  2   10 
           removed from the 212Atm/215At ambiguity.               C2020  2   11
