           MeV electrostatic accelerator.                         C1647  1   10 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) The NaI(Tl) crystals used were 1.5 inches in   C1647  1   11 
           diameter by 1.5 inches long.                           C1647  1   12 
SAMPLE     (6-C-13,ENR=0.60) The two targets used were 7 and 16   C1647  1   13 
           keV thick at 1.7 MeV and were composed of carbon,      C1647  1   14 
           enriched to 60 percent C13, deposited on a tantalum    C1647  1   15 
           backing.                                               C1647  1   16 
METHOD     The gamma rays were produced by bombarding C13         C1647  1   17 
           targets with protons. The protons were analyzed by     C1647  1   18 
           either an electrostatic or a magnetic analyzer set to  C1647  1   19 
           give an energy resolution of 0.1 to 0.2 percent. At    C1647  1   20 
           each resonance, before observing the pulse-height      C1647  1   21 
           spectrum, an excitation curve was run in order to      C1647  1   22 
           obtain the maximum intensity and also to be sure that  C1647  1   23 
           the observed radiation was characteristic of the       C1647  1   24 
           resonance.                                             C1647  1   25 
COMMENT    With the exception of the 8.90(1.47)- and 8.98(1.55)-  C1647  1   26 
           MeV resonance levels and the recalculated reduced      C1647  1   27 
           widths, the table is essentially Table III in          C1647  1   28 
           reference C1645 (J,PR,85,197,1952). Consequently,      C1647  1   29 
           only these two data points were compiled in order to   C1647  1   30 
           avoid duplication.                                     C1647  1   31
