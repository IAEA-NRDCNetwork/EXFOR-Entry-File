FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) Experiment was performed using the      C192200100009 
           Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at     C192200100010

DETECTOR   (MCPLT)Evaporation residues were detected using the    C192200100012 
           CSSER (Compact System for Studies of Evaporation       C192200100013 
           Residues) setup at Oak Ridge National Laboratory       C192200100014 
            (ORNL). Two microchannel-plate timing detectors       C192200100015 
           placed before the target were used to monitor the      C192200100016 
           incident beam and provide a timing reference. A third, C192200100017

           system was arranged so that only particles that were   C192200100021 
           significantly slower than the beam (primarily the      C192200100022 
           evaporation residues) were counted.                    C192200100023 
METHOD     (TOF)Time of flight method was used to identify the    C192200100024 
           beam particles as well as the slow evaporation         C192200100025
