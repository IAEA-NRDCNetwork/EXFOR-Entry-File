FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USATAM) Experiment performed using the K150    C2633  1   13 
           Cyclotron at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A+M      C2633  1   14

SAMPLE     Texas Active Target scattering chamber is a gas-filled C2633  1   16 
           Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a gas mixtureC2633  1   17 
           of 40Ar (95%) + CH4(5%)  at 150 Torr.                  C2633  1   18 
DETECTOR   Time projection chamber with a micromegas(Micro-MEsh   C2633  1   19 
           GAseous Structures) detector with 1024 read-out        C2633  1   20 
           channels on an active area of 224 x 240mm2.            C2633  1   21 
INC-SOURCE The primary 6Li beam was accelerated via the K150      C2633  1   22 
           Cyclotron to an energy of 9.9MeV/u and transported to  C2633  1   23 
           the cryogenic gas target located at the entrance of    C2633  1   24 
           Momentum Achromat Recoil Spectrometer (MARS) . The     C2633  1   25 
           secondary 8B beam was produced in-flight using the     C2633  1   26 
           6Li(3He,n) 8B reaction. The gas-cell target was        C2633  1   27 
           filled with 3He at a pressure of 800 Torr and          C2633  1   28 
           temperature of 77 K. A 97%- pure 5.1MeV/u 8B beam of   C2633  1   29 
           103pps was produced with an energy spread of 1.2 MeV.  C2633  1   30 
           Secondary beam was analyzed using MARS spectrometer.   C2633  1   31
