SAMPLE     The target consisted of a mixture of isotopes of       C2529  1   11 
           curium (95% Cm244 and 4.5% Cm246) mounted on a very    C2529  1   12 
           thin nickel foil. The target was approximately 0.5     C2529  1   13 
           mg/cm2 thick and was covered with ~75-microg/cm2       C2529  1   14 
           aluminum to prevent curium "knockover".                C2529  1   15

METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) In a series of experiments it was found  C2529  1   18 
           that Fm250 could be collected on the catcher foils in  C2529  1   19 
           accordance with a parent of half-life 3 seconds        C2529  1   20 
           produced in the reaction Cm246(C12,4n)No254) . The     C2529  1   21 
           number of Fm250 counts observed in a single            C2529  1   22 
           experiment was as great as 40 and corresponded to a    C2529  1   23 
           maximum cross section of a few microbarns for the      C2529  1   24 
           reaction with Cm246. Nuclear emulsions placed above    C2529  1   25 
           the moving belt to receive the alpha particles from    C2529  1   26 
           the decaying 102 atoms are being scanned to determine  C2529  1   27 
           the alpha energy of the 3-second No254, but there are  C2529  1   28 
           difficulties with this method since there are          C2529  1   29 
           hundreds of times as many tracks due to Fm250, Cf245,  C2529  1   30 
           Cf246, and other alpha emitters. The final             C2529  1   31 
           identification of the activity ascribed to Fm250 was   C2529  1   32 
           carried out by dissolving the activity from the        C2529  1   33 
           catcher foil and separating it from the other          C2529  1   34 
           actinide elements by elution with ammonium             C2529  1   35 
           alpha-hydroxyisobutyrate from a column packed with     C2529  1   36 
           Dowex-50 cation exchange resin.                        C2529  1   37
