INC-SOURCE LAMPF external proton beam with the stripped H+ beam   C191100100009

SAMPLE     The targets were 5 cm x 5 cm x 0.181 g/cm2 and 0.354   C191100100011 
           g/cm2 NE 102 plastic scintillators.                    C191100100012

METHOD     (ACTIV,GSPEC,BGCT) The 11C activity, which is 100%     C191100100015 
           beta+ decay to 11B, was measured after bombardment     C191100100016 
           using the a beta+gamma-gamma coincidence technique.    C191100100017 
           Each NaI windowed the 0.511 MeV annihilation           C191100100018 
           photopeak pulses. A gamma-gamma coincidence between    C191100100019 
           the two indicated a beta+ decay in a scintillator.     C191100100020 
ANALYSIS   (DECAY) The beta+, gamma-gamma, and beta+gamma-gamma   C191100100021 
           counts were all multiscaled and fitted to a half-life  C191100100022 
           curve with 11C 1224 sec half-life, and each had a      C191100100023 
           xi2/(degree of freedom) of approximately one.          C191100100024
