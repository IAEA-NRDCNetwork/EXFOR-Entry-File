FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) The experiment was performed at ISAC I C205200100011 
           facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver using the TUDA         C205200100012 
            (TRIUMF-U.K. Detector Array) chamber                  C205200100013 
SAMPLE     The target was 25mu-g/cm2 7LiF on a 10 mu-g/cm2        C205200100014 
           carbon backing. Elastic scattering on F nuclei was     C205200100015 
           used for calibration of detectors.                     C205200100016 
DETECTOR   (SISD) TUDA chamber contained Louvain-Edinburgh        C205200100017 
           Detector Array (LEDA), which consists of eight         C205200100018 
           separate azimuthal sectors, each with 16 radial        C205200100019 
           elements. This annular detector is 300 mu-m thick and  C205200100020 
           its active area spans radii from 50mm to 129.9mm. LEDA C205200100021 
           was placed at a distance of 7.2 cm form the target     C205200100022 
           (SISD) The S2 is a double sided silicon strip          C205200100023 
           detector consisting of a single element that is        C205200100024 
           divided into 16 azimuthal sectors on the back side     C205200100025 
           and 48 rings on the front. This 500 mu-m thick         C205200100026 
           detector has inner radius of 11.5 mm and an outer      C205200100027 
           radius of 35 mm. S2 detector was placed at the         C205200100028 
           distance of 13 cm from the target                      C205200100029 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between LEDA and S2 detectors was  C205200100030 
           required to identify the selected events.              C205200100031 
INC-SOURCE Radioactive 8Li(2+) beam at an energy of 11 MeV with anC205200100032 
           intensity of (9 - 16)*E+6/s was produced using ISAC 1  C205200100033 
           facility. Protons with energy of 500 MeV and current   C205200100034 
           up to 100 mu-A were steered onto production targets to C205200100035 
           produce 8Li nuclei which are separated by mass         C205200100036 
           separator and accelerated.                             C205200100037
