SAMPLE     Heavy-ion beam impinged on a solid target made out of  C2704  1   17 
           high-density polyethylene (C2H4)n. Target's effective  C2704  1   18 
           thickness was (3.95+-0.4) mu-m and the corresponding   C2704  1   19 
           areal density of hydrogen in the target                C2704  1   20 
           was (3.18+-0.32)E+19 atoms/cm2                         C2704  1   21 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Neutrons from the (p,n) reactions were          C2704  1   22 
           detected using low energy neutron detector array       C2704  1   23 
           LENDA. In this experiment LENDA consisted of 14        C2704  1   24 
           BC-408 scintillators arranged in two consecutive       C2704  1   25 
           layers downstream of the target, aligned at 35 cm and  C2704  1   26 
           41.5 cm from the target. The angular acceptance of     C2704  1   27 
           LENDA in the laboratory frame was from 5 deg to 52 deg.C2704  1   28 
           (MAGSP) Heavy reaction products were momentum          C2704  1   29 
           analysed in ReA3 beam line, consisting of              C2704  1   30 
           spectrometer dipole magnet, quadrupole multiplets,     C2704  1   31 
           4-jaw slit system at the focal plane of the            C2704  1   32 
           spectrometer magnet to block the deflected beam ions   C2704  1   33 
           and a piece of standard beam line to the Si detector.  C2704  1   34 
           (SISD) Reaction products were identified at the end    C2704  1   35 
           of ReA3 beamline using double sided Si strip           C2704  1   36 
           detector. The detector has an active area of 40.3 x    C2704  1   37 
           75.0 mm2 and consists of 64 vertical strips on the     C2704  1   38 
           junction side and 4 horizontal strips on the Ohmic     C2704  1   39 
           side. The effective thickness of the detector was      C2704  1   40 
           1000 mu-m                                              C2704  1   41 
METHOD     (COINC) Coincidence between SISD detector and LENDA    C2704  1   42 
           array was required. Inverse kinematics was used.       C2704  1   43 
           (TOF,PSD) Neutron energy was determined by time-of-    C2704  1   44 
           flight. Start time was provided by SiSD detector, stop C2704  1   45 
           signal was provided by LENDA array.                    C2704  1   46 
ANALYSIS   Final result was determined as weighted average of     C2704  1   47 
           two runs.                                              C2704  1   48
