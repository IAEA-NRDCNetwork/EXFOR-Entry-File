DETECTOR   (GELI) A 2.5%-efficient Ge(Li) detector at             C2669  2   13 
           approximately 125 degrees from the beam direction and  C2669  2   14 
           at 5 cm from the target.                               C2669  2   15 
SAMPLE     (26-FE-56,ENR=0.994) The target was a 0.90-mg/cm2      C2669  2   16 
           iron foil.                                             C2669  2   17 
CORRECTION Dead-time and amplifier pileup corrections, and        C2669  2   18 
           run-to-run normalizations.                             C2669  2   19 
ANALYSIS   Excitation functions for the first eight excited       C2669  2   20 
           states of 56Co were taken at 125 degrees in order to   C2669  2   21 
           minimize angular distribution effects.                 C2669  2   22 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors arise from uncertainties in threeC2669  2   23 
           different quantities:                                  C2669  2   24 
           1) the y-ray peak areas,                               C2669  2   25 
           2) the detector relative gamma-ray efficiency          C2669  2   26 
           corrections,                                           C2669  2   27 
           3) the run-to-run normalization.                       C2669  2   28 
           Error values taken from the figure. For data without   C2669  2   29 
           given errors the errors are smaller than the data-pointC2669  2   30 
           symbols (about 6%).                                    C2669  2   31

DETECTOR   (GELI) A 2.5%-efficient Ge(Li) detector was positioned C2669 32    4 
           with its face 12.7 cm from the center of the target    C2669 32    5 
           and at 90 degrees to the beam.                         C2669 32    6 
SAMPLE     The 56Fe foil was placed at 55 degrees with respect to C2669 32    7 
           the beam direction. The 0.90+/-0.09-mg/cm2 target      C2669 32    8 
           thickness was determined by measuring the energy loss  C2669 32    9 
           of 5.48-MeV alpha particles from an 241Am source. The  C2669 32   10 
           target was placed 15 cm in front of the Faraday cup.   C2669 32   11

ANALYSIS   The absolute normalization of the counting efficiency  C2669 32   13 
           curve was determined for the geometry used by counting C2669 32   14 
           57Co, 137Cs, 54Mn, and 60Co intensity standards. The   C2669 32   15 
           precision quoted for the standards was +/-5%.          C2669 32   16 
           The neutron feeding to each state was determined from  C2669 32   17
