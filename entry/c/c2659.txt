           Laboratory (TUNL) Enge split-pole spectrograph.        C265900100012 
SAMPLE     Targets were produced under vacuum by thermally        C265900100013 
           evaporating NaBr powder onto 22 mu-g/cm2-thick         C265900100014 
           natural carbon backing foils. The NaBr thickness, as   C265900100015 
           measured with a thickness monitor during evaporation,  C265900100016 
           was approximately 70 mu-g/cm2. The exact sodium        C265900100017 
           concentration was not required for the experiment      C265900100018 
           since the measurement was performed relative to the    C265900100019 
           elastic scattering cross section.                      C265900100020 
METHOD     (EDE) The proton transfer experiment was performed at  C265900100021 
           TUNL using the Enge split-pole spectrograph. The       C265900100022 
           instrument is located at the end of the                C265900100023 
           high-resolution beam line at the TUNL Tandem           C265900100024 
           accelerator laboratory, where two 90-degree dipole     C265900100025 
           analyzing magnets deliver beams of precisely           C265900100026 
           controlled energies to the target. A 3He++ beam        C265900100027 
           energy of 21 MeV was chosen to minimize the presence   C265900100028 
           of contaminants in spectral areas. The NaBr targets    C265900100029 
           were placed on a target ladder along with a natural    C265900100030 
           carbon backing foil for background identification.     C265900100031 
           The beam current was monitored with an                 C265900100032 
           electron-suppressed beam stop downstream from the      C265900100033 
           targets. A silicon telescope was placed at 45 degree   C265900100034 
           to monitor target degradation, and beam fluctuations,  C265900100035 
           and to normalize the data. Reaction products from the  C265900100036 
           target entered the Enge split-pole spectrograph        C265900100037 
           through a 1 msr aperture and were momentum-analyzed    C265900100038 
           with a magnetic field. Deuterons were clearly          C265900100039 
           identified with a dE vs E cut. These spectra were      C265900100040 
           internally calibrated using precisely known states in  C265900100041 
           24Mg.                                                  C265900100042 
ANALYSIS   Over the entire focal plane, most states are in good   C265900100043 
           agreement with the literature energies with an average C265900100044 
           deviation of 1.3-sigma.                                C265900100045
