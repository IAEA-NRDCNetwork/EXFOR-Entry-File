SAMPLE     (6-C-12,ENR=0.99945) All targets used in the present   C1589  1   11 
           experiment were made by the thermal cracking of        C1589  1   12 
           methyl iodide by means of an electric current passed   C1589  1   13 
           through a 0.008 cm thick tantalum strip; when the      C1589  1   14 
           strip is heated, the methyl iodide decomposes, and a   C1589  1   15 
           layer of elemental carbon is deposited on the strip.   C1589  1   16 
           The methyl iodide was prepared from two different      C1589  1   17 
           samples of 12C. The first target had the 13C content   C1589  1   18 
           of the elemental carbon targets prepared from this     C1589  1   19 
           material was about 0.1 %. The second target the        C1589  1   20 
           starting material for the targets was methyl alcohol,  C1589  1   21 
           in which the 13C/C ratio was believed to be <50 parts  C1589  1   22 
           per million.                                           C1589  1   23

METHOD     (PHD) The angular distribution measurements were used  C1589  2    5 
           to separate the observed ground state gamma-radiation  C1589  2    6 
           into El and E2 components, on the assumption that the  C1589  2    7 
           E2 radiation has the energy dependence to be expected  C1589  2    8 
           for direct E2 radiative capture. The angular           C1589  2    9 
           distributions thus determine a normalization for the   C1589  2   10 
           strength of the E2 capture, and the calculated E2      C1589  2   11 
           radiation components were subtracted from the          C1589  2   12 
           observed yields at those energies for which angular    C1589  2   13 
           distribution measurements were not possible because    C1589  2   14 
           of low intensity.                                      C1589  2   15 
ANALYSIS   (PGS) The first step in the extraction of the 160      C1589  2   16 
           ground-state gamma-ray yields from the two-dimensional C1589  2   17 
           spectra was to identify a rectangular region-of-       C1589  2   18 
           interest in the time energy (pulse-height) plane. The  C1589  2   19 
           background spectrum was normalized to the 12C          C1589  2   20 
           spectrum according to the height of the prompt         C1589  2   21 
           neutron peak and the magnitude of the                  C1589  2   22 
           time-independent background, and was then subtracted   C1589  2   23 
           from the 12C spectrum to obtain the gamma-ray yield.   C1589  2   24 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The errors shown are derived from the       C1589  2   25 
           statistical errors on the 90 degrees gamma-ray yields  C1589  2   26 
           and from the uncertainties in the strength of the E2   C1589  2   27 
           radiation.                                             C1589  2   28
