SAMPLE     Pure gold was readily available in 4 in.x4 in. sheets, C2489  2    4 
           ~2.6 mg/cm2 thick, as dental gold foil. The gold       C2489  2    5 
           target consisted of several thicknesses of this foil   C2489  2    6 
           cut into a strip approximately 1cm by 8cm. It was      C2489  2    7 
           bombarded between two pure aluminum foils, each about  C2489  2    8 
           3 mg/cm2 thick, which served to catch fission          C2489  2    9 
           fragments escaping from the target foil.               C2489  2   10
