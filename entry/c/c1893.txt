DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Reaction products were momentum analyzed with  C189300100014 
           S800 spectrograph and identified using set of          C189300100015

           (SCIN) Plastic scintillation detectors were used to    C189300100019 
           measure time of flight of projectile ions and reaction C189300100020 
           products. Two scintilation detectors were placed       C189300100021 
           before the reaction target for incident particle       C189300100022

           (HPGE) The SeGA array of 32-fold segmented high-       C189300100024 
           purity germanium detectors, was used to detect the     C189300100025 
           de-excitation gamma rays emitted by the reaction       C189300100026 
           residues. Sixteen of the SeGA detectors were arranged  C189300100027 
           in two rings with relative angles of 90 deg (9         C189300100028 
           detectors) and 37 deg (7 detectors) with respect to    C189300100029 
           the beam axis. The high degree of segmentation allows  C189300100030 
           for event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the       C189300100031

INC-SOURCE (KINDT) Projectile beam containing 48Cr and 50Fe was   C189300100035 
           produced by fragmentation of a 160-MeV/nucleon 58Ni    C189300100036 
           primary beam. The 893 mg/cm2 thick 9Be production      C189300100037 
           target was located at the mid-acceptance target        C189300100038 
           position of NSCL's A1900 fragment separator. An        C189300100039 
           achromatic Al wedge of 300 mg/cm2 thickness together   C189300100040 
           with slit systems were used to optimize the beam       C189300100041 
           purity on 50Fe. The resulting cocktail beam of N = 24  C189300100042 
           isotones was transmitted to the reaction target        C189300100043 
           position of the S800 spectrograph at typical rates of  C189300100044 
           2500, 2000, and 500 particles/s and purities of 39%,   C189300100045 
           40%, and 11%, respectively, for 48Cr, 49Mn, and 50Fe   C189300100046 
           at dp/p = 1% total A1900 momentum acceptance.          C189300100047 
ANALYSIS   Reaction products were identified by energy loss and   C189300100048 
           time of flight. Primary particles were identified by   C189300100049
