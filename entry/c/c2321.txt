INC-SPECT  A rather wide incident energy spectrum (extending up   C2321  1    9 
           to 30 MeV).                                            C2321  1   10

METHOD     (ACTIV) After bombardments lasting from one to thirty  C2321  1   12 
           minutes the targets were withdrawn through the air     C2321  1   13 
           lock and placed under a shielded thin-window Geiger    C2321  1   14 
           counter. Usually about two minutes elapsed from the    C2321  1   15 
           time the beam was turned off until counting began.     C2321  1   16 
           Targets were counted continuously until the counting   C2321  1   17 
           rate for induced activities approximated background.   C2321  1   18 
           It was thus possible to detect half-lives ranging      C2321  1   19 
           from one minute to several days. In general, there     C2321  1   20 
           were several induced activities in each target.        C2321  1   21 
           Standard graphical methods were used to determine      C2321  1   22 
           half-lives and analyze decay curves. From the known    C2321  1   23 
           bombardment time and rate of decay, the relative       C2321  1   24 
           thick-target yields for the production of radioactive  C2321  1   25 
           isotopes were calculated.                              C2321  1   26

ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The below listed factors contributed a      C2321  1   28 
           probable error in relative cross sections of less      C2321  1   29 
           than 20% for any one target element, and less than     C2321  1   30 
           50% from one element to another.                       C2321  1   31

           2. Target impurities: commercially available target    C2321  1   33 
           materials were usually pure to a few parts per thousandC2321  1   34 
           in cases where unexpected impurities appeared, in TaN, C2321  1   35 
           for example, they were readily detected by the         C2321  1   36 
           anomalous decay curve.                                 C2321  1   37 
           3. Changes in the target during bombardment: stable    C2321  1   38 
           compounds with high dissociation temperatures were     C2321  1   39 
           chosen as target materials in order to avoid changes inC2321  1   40 
            the chemical composition of the target during         C2321  1   41 
           bombardment; targets bombarded with reduced beams gave C2321  1   42 
           the same results, within the limits of accuracy, as    C2321  1   43 
           those bombarded with intense beams.                    C2321  1   44 
           4. Analysis of decay schemes: decay curves containing  C2321  1   45 
           more than two or three half-lives are difficult to     C2321  1   46 
           analyze accurately; with several independent analyzers C2321  1   47 
           and a variety of targets, we were able to reproduce    C2321  1   48 
           relative yield values to within the estimated error.   C2321  1   49 
           5. Variation of beam energy distribution: relative     C2321  1   50 
           yields depend on the beam energy spectrum, vide supra; C2321  1   51 
           errors due to this cause were investigated by          C2321  1   52 
           bombarding the same target element a number of times   C2321  1   53 
           and by bombarding carbon targets periodically. No      C2321  1   54 
           serious changes in relative yields were found.         C2321  1   55

SAMPLE     The beryllium target was a 5-mil foil obtained         C2321  6    5 
           commercially. A 1/16-inch thick BeO target was used    C2321  6    6 
           to tie the Be reaction yield to that of oxygen which   C2321  6    7 
           was previously related to the carbon yield.            C2321  6    8
