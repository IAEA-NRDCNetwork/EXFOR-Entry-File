INC-SPECT  (EN-RSL) The horizontal bars on the                    C1851  1   10 
           figures are not errors but indicate the energy spread  C1851  1   11 
           due to target thickness.                               C1851  1   12 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) 4pi scintillation counter.                      C1851  1   13 
SAMPLE     The 016 targets used for the different runs were cut   C1851  1   14 
           out of a single sheet of 0.70 mg/cm2 muscovite mica.   C1851  1   15 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Thin mica targets were irradiated by various   C1851  1   16 
           energy triton beams. The decay was followed in each    C1851  1   17 
           case for at least eight half-lives and usually more.   C1851  1   18 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-1) The values of the absolute cross section       C1851  1   19 
           are only good to about 20 percent due to the           C1851  1   20 
           difficulty of obtaining a reliable absolute            C1851  1   21 
           measurement. Because of this difficulty the vertical   C1851  1   22 
           scale should be considered only as a rough indication  C1851  1   23 
           of the absolute value.                                 C1851  1   24
