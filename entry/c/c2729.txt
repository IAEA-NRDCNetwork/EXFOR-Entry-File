METHOD     The spalls enter the surface of nuclear track          C2729  1   11 
           emulsion making a small angle with the surface. The    C2729  1   12 
           position, track-angle, range, and estimate charge are  C2729  1   13 
           recorded for each track. The calculated radius of      C2729  1   14 
           curvature plotted against the range provides a         C2729  1   15 
           nuclide spectrum of the tracks, since each nuclide     C2729  1   16 
           falls on a definite locus in such a diagram.           C2729  1   17 
           Resolution of H1, H2, H3, He3, and He4 splinters is    C2729  1   18 
           unambiguous. A group probably comprising Li6 and Be7   C2729  1   19 
           and another group probably of He6 and Li7 are also     C2729  1   20 
           found, but for lack of good range-energy curves for    C2729  1   21 
           highly charged particles the resolution is at present  C2729  1   22 
           uncertain. No Li8, B8, H>3 or He<3 tracks were found.  C2729  1   23
