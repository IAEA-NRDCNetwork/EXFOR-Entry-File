SAMPLE     The targets were circular disks of the pilot B         C2341  1   11 
           plastic scintillator of thickness 0.310 g cm-2 and     C2341  1   12 
           containing 91.55% carbon by weight.                    C2341  1   13 
DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN) 7.6x7.6-cm NaI scintillator, plastic      C2341  1   14 
           scintillator target.                                   C2341  1   15 
METHOD     (ACTIV) After the beam was turned off the target was   C2341  1   16 
           transported to the Nuclear Counting Laboratory, about  C2341  1   17 
           5 km from the irradiation station. Two methods of      C2341  1   18 
           counting were used: internal scintillation counting    C2341  1   19 
           and annihilation radiation counting in an NaI well     C2341  1   20 
           counter.                                               C2341  1   21 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The error listed is made up of the          C2341  1   22 
           standard deviation of the end of bombardment count     C2341  1   23 
           rate (given by the least-squares analysis program),    C2341  1   24 
           the uncertainty in absolute counting efficiency, and   C2341  1   25 
           the estimated error in the correction for varying      C2341  1   26 
           beam intensity in the case of those runs in which the  C2341  1   27 
           variation was large.                                   C2341  1   28
