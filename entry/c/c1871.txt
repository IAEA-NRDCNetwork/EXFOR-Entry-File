DETECTOR   (HPGE)The detector had a relative efficiency of 62% at C187100100013 
           1.33 MeV as compared with a standard NaI crystal.The   C187100100014 
           full width at half maximum resolution of the detector  C187100100015 
           was 1.3keV at 181 keV,2.0keV at 739keV,                C187100100016 
           and 2.9keV at 1368keV. The activity of each            C187100100017 
           foil was measured at a distance of 10cm from the front C187100100018 
           face of the detector.                                  C187100100019
