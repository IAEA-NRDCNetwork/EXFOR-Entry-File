FACILITY   (LINAC,1CANTMF) Experiment carried out using the       C2855001   16 
           DRAGON recoil separator at TRIUMF, Vancouver           C2855001   17 
SAMPLE     Helium-filled DRAGON windowless gas target with        C2855001   18 
           effective length of (12.3+-0.1) cm and He pressure     C2855001   19 
           between 4.92 and 7.9 torr.                             C2855001   20 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) For mass and momentum selection an             C2855001   21 
           electromagnetic mass separator was used, which         C2855001   22 
           consists of two magnetic (M) and two electric dipoles  C2855001   23 
            (E) in a MEME configuration.                          C2855001   24 
           (BGO) Prompt gamma rays were detected using an array   C2855001   25 
           of 30 BGO scintillators with phototubes covering       C2855001   26 
           covering 89-92% of the 4Pi solid angle. It was used    C2855001   27 
           also fore tagging of the associated recoil particles   C2855001   28 
           for additional background reduction in the focal       C2855001   29 
           plane detectors.                                       C2855001   30 
           (MCPLT,SISD) Focal plane detector consisting of        C2855001   31 
           microchannel plate and a double-sided silicon-strip    C2855001   32 
           detector. The microchannel plate provided the          C2855001   33 
           starting timing sig nalfor a local time-of-flight. In  C2855001   34 
           the Si strip detector the recoils are stopped, their   C2855001   35 
           kinetic energy and position are measured, and the      C2855001   36 
           stopping timing signal is recorded.                    C2855001   37

INC-SOURCE Beams of 7Be+ were produced using the ISOL technique   C2855001   39 
           by bombarding thick ZrC and graphite targets with 55   C2855001   40 
           muA 500 MeV protons from the TRIUMF cyclotron. 7Li     C2855001   41 
           and 7Be were extracted from the target through a       C2855001   42 
           high- resolution mass separator, and the beryllium     C2855001   43 
           ionization was enhanced using the TRIUMF Resonant      C2855001   44 
           Ionization Laser Ion Source. After the ion source,     C2855001   45 
           the beam was transported through the ISAC              C2855001   46 
           high-resolution mass separator and then accelerated    C2855001   47 
           through the ISAC-I radio frequency quadrupole and      C2855001   48 
           drift-tube linac to final energy.                      C2855001   49
