FACILITY   (SYNCH,1USABRK) Bevatron, a weak-focusing proton       C2647  1    8 
           synchrotron.                                           C2647  1    9 
DETECTOR   (SCIN,CEREN) Plastic scintillator and Cherenkov        C2647  1   10 
           counters.                                              C2647  1   11 
METHOD     (TOF) The Bevatron proton beam impinges on a copper    C2647  1   12 
           target and negative particles scattered in the         C2647  1   13 
           forward direction with momentum 1.19 BeV/c. These      C2647  1   14 
           particles are deflected 21 degrees by the field of     C2647  1   15 
           the Bevatron, arid an additional 32 degrees by magnet  C2647  1   16 
           M1. With the aid of the quadrupole focusing magnet Q1  C2647  1   17 
            (consisting of 3 consecutive quadrupole magnets)      C2647  1   18 
           these particles are brought to a focus at the first    C2647  1   19 
           scintillation counter. For protons of our selected     C2647  1   20 
           momentum the mass is measured to about 10 percent.     C2647  1   21 
           The observed times of flight for antiprotons are made  C2647  1   22 
           more meaningful by the fact that the electronic gate   C2647  1   23 
           time is considerably longer than the spread of         C2647  1   24 
           observed antiproton flight times. A very rough         C2647  1   25 
           determination has been made of the dependence of       C2647  1   26 
           antiproton production cross section on the energy of   C2647  1   27 
           the Bevatron proton beam.                              C2647  1   28
