DETECTOR   (SCIN) The two scintillators had diameters 4 inches    C2609  1   10 
           and 3 inches and were placed, respectively, 8 inches   C2609  1   11 
           and 11 inches below the center of the scattering       C2609  1   12 
           chamber.                                               C2609  1   13

METHOD     (COINC) The beam of pions enters the experimental      C2609  1   15 
           space and is deflected by an analyzing magnet. After   C2609  1   16 
           this, it is recorded by the coincidences of two        C2609  1   17 
           1-inch-square crystals and falls on the liquid         C2609  1   18 
           hydrogen scattering chamber. The scattered products    C2609  1   19 
           are observed by quadruple coincidences of these two    C2609  1   20 
           counters with another pair of scintillators located    C2609  1   21 
           directly under the scattering chamber in a direction   C2609  1   22 
           at 90 degrees to that of the incident pions. In order  C2609  1   23 
           to increase the sensitivity of the scattering          C2609  1   24 
           detectors to gamma-rays, a lead radiator 1/4 inch      C2609  1   25 
           thick was interposed in front of the third counter. A  C2609  1   26 
           standard measurement involved the observation of the   C2609  1   27 
           ratio between scattered and incident particles with    C2609  1   28 
           and without hydrogen in the scattering chamber, and    C2609  1   29 
           with and without the lead converter of the             C2609  1   30 
           gamma radiation.                                       C2609  1   31

ANALYSIS   The conversion to a scattering cross section depends   C2609  2    4 
           on the assumptions made as to the angular              C2609  2    5 
           distribution. It also depends on the assumption that   C2609  2    6 
           me have made in this paper that all neutral pions      C2609  2    7 
           decay immediately into two photons. For example, if    C2609  2    8 
           we assume that the angular distribution is fairly      C2609  2    9 
           isotropic in the center-of-mass system and that the    C2609  2   10 
           gamma-rays are produced in pairs by the decay of the   C2609  2   11 
           neutral pions.                                         C2609  2   12
