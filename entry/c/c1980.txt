DETECTOR   (SCIN) Protons and deuterons were detected by          C198000100012 
           scintillators and spark chambers.                      C198000100013 
METHOD     (COINC,TOF) The detection apparatus was a coincidence  C198000100014 
           spectrometer. On the basis of the known spatial        C198000100015 
           resolution of the spark chambers and the reaction      C198000100016

           angles greater than 95 degrees in the laboratory       C198000100019 
           would be the angular correlation of the proton and     C198000100020 
           deuteron. For proton laboratory angles smaller than    C198000100021 
           95 degrees selection of the deuteron by time of        C198000100022 
           flight and proton energy by range were considered      C198000100023 
           necessary to reduce the inelastic contributions to     C198000100024 
           manageable levels.                                     C198000100025 
SAMPLE     A single CD2, target (hydrogen content less  than 2%)  C198000100026 
           0.202 cm thick by 10 cm by 10 cm  was used throughout  C198000100027 
           the experiment.                                        C198000100028 
ANALYSIS   As soon as the information associated with each event  C198000100029 
           was placed in buffer regions of the computer memory,   C198000100030 
           an attempt at geometrical reconstruction was made      C198000100031 
           directly on line, allowing a check of the progress of  C198000100032 
           the experiment. To avoid the need of maintaining one ofC198000100033 
           the c.m. solid angles larger than the other to         C198000100034 
           minimize border and resolution effects, we classified  C198000100035 
           the events in bins on the proton scattering angle      C198000100036 
           thetap and displayed for each of these bins the        C198000100037 
           complete correlation spectrum in the sum angles        C198000100038 
            (thetap+thetad). The cross section for each proton    C198000100039 
           bin of width delta thetap around thetap was            C198000100040 
           calculated with standard formalism.                    C198000100041

           areal density and 4% error in efficiency; (b) from one C198000100046
