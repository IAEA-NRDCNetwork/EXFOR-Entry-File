DETECTOR   (NAICR,SCIN,MAGSP) The experimental apparatus          C198500100014 
           includes NSCL NaI(Tl) array, large acceptance S800     C198500100015 
           superconducting spectrograph. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array   C198500100016 
           consists of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3      C198500100017 
           concentric rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10    C198500100018 
            (outer) detectors, respectively. The radii of the     C198500100019 
           three detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm, C198500100020 
            respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,           C198500100021 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C198500100022 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C198500100023 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C198500100024 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C198500100025 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C198500100026 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C198500100027 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C198500100028 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C198500100029 
           cm thick lead shield.                                  C198500100030 
METHOD     (COINC,GSPEC,TOF) The gamma rays from the decay of     C198500100031 
           13B excited states were detected by an array of 38     C198500100032 
           cylindrical NaI(Tl) detectors which completely         C198500100033 
           surrounded the target. Recoiling 13B core fragments    C198500100034 
           were momentum analyzed using the S800 spectrograph.    C198500100035 
           The targets of Be and Au were 228 and 256 mg/cm2       C198500100036 
           thick, respectively, chosen to produce an energy       C198500100037 
           straggling of about the same magnitude as the          C198500100038 
           resolution of the spectrograph. Time-of-flight         C198500100039 
           information over a distance of 70 m combined with      C198500100040 
           the energy loss and total energy signal obtained with  C198500100041 
           a segmented ion chamber and a 5 cm thick plastic       C198500100042 
           scintillator, respectively, were used to identify and  C198500100043 
           measure the yields of the fragments in the focal       C198500100044 
           plane of the spectrograph. Two x/y position-sensitive  C198500100045 
           cathode-readout drift chambers in the focal plane      C198500100046 
           were used to determine the momentum and angle          C198500100047 
           information of the fragments.                          C198500100048 
ANALYSIS   (PGS) An energy spectrum of gamma rays in coincidence  C198500100049 
           with 13B fragments has been transformed into the       C198500100050 
           projectile rest frame using the position of the        C198500100051 
           incident g ray measured in the NaI array, which        C198500100052 
           allows for Doppler correction on an event-by-event     C198500100053 
           basis via Monte-Carlo simulation using the code        C198500100054 
           GEANT. The simulation took into account Doppler        C198500100055 
           broadening, the distortion of the shapes caused by     C198500100056 
           the back transformation to the projectile rest frame,  C198500100057 
           and the calculated gamma-ray detection efficiencies.   C198500100058
