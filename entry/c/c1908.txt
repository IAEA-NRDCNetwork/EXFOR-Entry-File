FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAORL) The experiment was carried out at the   C190800100011 
           Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF).       C190800100012 
DETECTOR   (MCPLT,IOCH)Two carbon-foil-based microchannel plate   C190800100013 
           timing detectors were used to monitor                  C190800100014 
           the beam and provide timing references. The            C190800100015 
           evaporation residues were detected by a downstream     C190800100016 
           MCP and a zero-degree ionization chamber.              C190800100017 
METHOD     (TOF) Time-of-flight and energy loss were used to      C190800100018 
           identify the evaporation residues using inverse        C190800100019 
           kinematics.                                            C190800100020 
INC-SOURCE Neutron rich radioactive Sn isotopes were produced by  C190800100021 
           proton induced uranium fission, ionized, mass selected C190800100022 
           and accelerated. Highly enriched Sn beams were         C190800100023 
           obtained by introducing sulfur to the ion source to    C190800100024 
           make SnS+ molecular ions that were subsequently broken C190800100025 
           up in the charge exchange cell. Beams of 126,127,128Sn C190800100026 
           and 132Sn energies were accelerated                    C190800100027
