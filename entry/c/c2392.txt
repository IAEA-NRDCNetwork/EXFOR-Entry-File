DETECTOR   (GEMUC) The Geiger tube was 1.5 inches i.d. and had a  C2392  1   10 
           3 mil tungsten wire exposed for 3 inches.              C2392  1   11 
METHOD     (ACTIV,STTA,CHSEP) The bombardment of a stack of       C2392  1   12 
           foils was made in the beam defining slit system of     C2392  1   13 
           the Washington University cyclotron. The deuteron      C2392  1   14 
           beam at the normal target position passed through a    C2392  1   15 
           narrow vertical slit and down an evacuated tube. The   C2392  1   16 
           target foils were one foot beyond this slit. The       C2392  1   17 
           foils were mounted at the rear of a Faraday cage       C2392  1   18 
           which could be moved in and out of the deuteron beam   C2392  1   19 
           by means of a support rod through a Wilson seal. The   C2392  1   20 
           activities, other than the 34-hour Br82, produced by   C2392  1   21 
           bombardment of selenium with low energy deuterons are  C2392  1   22 
           short-lived compared to the 34-hour activity. The      C2392  1   23 
           irradiated sodium or potassium bromide deposits were   C2392  1   24 
           dissolved in water and the solution acidified with     C2392  1   25 
           nitric acid and boiled to remove krypton activities.   C2392  1   26 
           Silver bromide was then precipitated, digested,        C2392  1   27 
           filtered onto tared filter paper, dried, and weighed   C2392  1   28 
           for the chemical yield determination. The sample was   C2392  1   29 
           then mounted on cardboard under half-mil aluminum and  C2392  1   30 
           3 mg/cm2 Cellophane, and counted in the same geometry  C2392  1   31 
           as the selenium foils.                                 C2392  1   32 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR,20.,30.) The relative values of the cross    C2392  1   33 
           sections are believed to be reliable to 5 or 10        C2392  1   34 
           percent. The uncertainty in the absolute values may    C2392  1   35 
           be as large as 20 or 30 percent because of             C2392  1   36 
           uncertainties in the absolute beta-counting            C2392  1   37

SAMPLE     Sodium bromide and potassium bromide deposits for the  C2392  2    4 
           d,p reaction on bromine were prepared individually by  C2392  2    5 
           evaporation of the salts onto half-mil aluminum in a   C2392  2    6 
           bell-jar vacuum system. The area of a deposit was      C2392  2    7 
           defined by a masking foil of aluminum. The aluminum    C2392  2    8 
           collection foils were weighed before and after         C2392  2    9 
           evaporation and the weight of salt (~1 mg/cm2)         C2392  2   10 
           determined by difference.                              C2392  2   11 
METHOD     Cross section was obtained from two independent runs   C2392  2   12 
           in which the beam current was measured.                C2392  2   13
