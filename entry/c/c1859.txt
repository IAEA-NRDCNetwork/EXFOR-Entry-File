FACILITY   (SYNCY,1USACHI) Experiment performed at the Chicago    C185900100008 
           170-inch synchrocyclotron.                             C185900100009 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm scintillators with        C185900100010 
           thickness of 0.635cm were used to define beam. A       C185900100011 
           91/2-inch diameter liquid scintillator counter was     C185900100012 
           placed coaxial with the beam defined by the first two  C185900100013 
           counters and at variable distance. It was connected    C185900100014 
           in anticoincidence with the coincidence output of the  C185900100015 
           first two counters so as to count directly the number  C185900100016 
           of particles removed from the beam. Thin scatterers    C185900100017 
            (sample of 90-95 percent beam transmission) were      C185900100018 
           placed directly after the second crystal counter.      C185900100019 
METHOD     (TRN) Measured using transmission method.              C185900100020 
ANALYSIS   Correction for Coulomb scattering was made from        C185900100021 
           measured data at several small angles larger than      C185900100022 
           zero.Total cross section was obtained by extrapolation C185900100023 
           of measured data to zero angle.                        C185900100024
