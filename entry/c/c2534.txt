SAMPLE     The target was a 19-mm disc of natural uranium,        C2534  2    4 
           0.25-mm thick. The range of 136Xe from the surface of  C2534  2    5 
           2 the target to the reaction barrier was taken to be   C2534  2    6 
           17 mg/cm2 for all of the Xe + U experiments.           C2534  2    7

METHOD     (CHSEP,ASPEC) Following the experiment the target was  C2534  2    9 
           dissolved in a 10 ml solution of 2 M HCl containing 1  C2534  2   10

           remove undissolved carbon deposits that formed on the  C2534  2   12 
           surface of the target during the irradiation. The      C2534  2   13 
           sample was briefly counted for alpha particle          C2534  2   14

           for spontaneous fission and alpha events for           C2534  2   17

           obtained following irradiations of 0. 25-mm x 16-mm    C2534  2   19 
           diameter natural uranium metal targets. After the      C2534  2   20 
           heavy-ion irradiations the targets were placed in a    C2534  2   21 
           sidearm flask which was connected with Tygon tubing    C2534  2   22

ANALYSIS   By making a comparison of the 136Xe + 160Gd and 136Xe  C2534  5    4 
           + 238U reaction to make 212Pb and 290Ds, respectively, C2534  5    5 
           it can be seen that both reactions require the         C2534  5    6 
           transfer of 18 protons and 34 + n neutrons. Since      C2534  5    7 
           both irradiations were thick target experiments and    C2534  5    8 
           include projectile energies from 1150 MeV to the       C2534  5    9 
           barrier, there would have been transfer product        C2534  5   10 
           nuclei heavier than the target from both reactions     C2534  5   11 
           having the same excitation energies and corresponding  C2534  5   12 
           to the same number of protons and neutrons             C2534  5   13 
           transferred. Based on this result an argument is       C2534  5   14 
           given that the upper limit cross section for the       C2534  5   15
