REL-REF    (N,,G.Hackman+,J,NP/A,682,356,2001)                    C197300100011 
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMSU)                                        C197300100012 
           (FRS,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed using the   C197300100013 
           A1200 Fragment Separator(FRS).                         C197300100014 
DETECTOR   (COIN,NAICR,SCIN) The experimental apparatus includes  C197300100015 
           NSCL NaI(Tl) array, silicon PIN, TOF and dE/E and      C197300100016 
           tracking detectors. The NSCL NaI(Tl) array consists    C197300100017 
           of 38 detectors, which are arranged in 3 concentric    C197300100018 
           rings, of 11 (inner), 17 (middle) and 10 (outer)       C197300100019 
           detectors, respectively. The radii of the three        C197300100020 
           detector rings are 10.8 cm, 16.9 cm and 21.8 cm,       C197300100021 
           respectively. The crystals are cylindrical,            C197300100022 
           approximately 18.0 cm long and 5.75 cm in diameter     C197300100023 
           and placed into a 0.45 mm thick aluminum shield. A 1   C197300100024 
           cm thick quartz window is attached to each end.        C197300100025 
           Optical glue was used to connect 5 cm in diameter      C197300100026 
           photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to each window. To        C197300100027 
           shield the NaI(Tl) detector array from photons         C197300100028 
           originating at the phoswich detector, and natural      C197300100029 
           radioactivity, the entire array was placed into a 16   C197300100030 
           cm thick lead shield. The phoswich detector has a      C197300100031 
           diameter of 101.6 mm and is made of 100 mm thick.      C197300100032 
           Slow plastic scintillator (Bicron 444) and a thin      C197300100033 
           layer (0.6 mm thick) of fast plastic scintillator      C197300100034 
            (Bicron 400) is glued to it. The detector is viewed   C197300100035 
           through a lightguide by 2 PMTs (THORN EMI              C197300100036 
           ElectronTubes 9807B02). The PMTs were attached by      C197300100037 
           using Tracon F113 epoxy. In addition, a water cooling  C197300100038 
           system was installed to cool down the PMT voltage      C197300100039 
           dividers because the detector operates in a vacuum.    C197300100040

ANALYSIS   (PGS,INTAD) To determine excitation probabilities,     C197300100043 
           GEANT simulations were performed for the g-rays that   C197300100044 
           were expected to be observed in the experiment. To     C197300100045 
           test the simulations, the efficiency of the array was  C197300100046 
           measured with a standard 88Y source. The decay from a  C197300100047 
           given state was modeled by taking the appropriate      C197300100048 
           linear combinations of the simulated spectra using     C197300100049 
           experimental branching ratios reported for 19Ne.       C197300100050 
           These branching ratios themselves have measurement     C197300100051 
           uncertainties, but the errors are correlated since     C197300100052 
           the sum of the branching ratios must add up to 1. An   C197300100053 
           error in the branching ratios, then, would             C197300100054 
           simultaneously overpredict one branch and              C197300100055 
           underpredict another, the net result being a           C197300100056 
           second-order systematic effect which is much smaller   C197300100057 
           than the statistical uncertainties in our              C197300100058 
           measurement. The normalizations of these summed,       C197300100059 
           simulated spectra for each state were then treated as  C197300100060 
           free parameters in a MINUIT xi2 minimization to best   C197300100061 
           fit the observed g-ray spectrum. A broad Gaussian near C197300100062 
           5.3 MeV was also required to fit the data; it may      C197300100063 
           describe unresolved decay from Ex>5 MeV states for     C197300100064
