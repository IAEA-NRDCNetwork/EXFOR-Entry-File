FACILITY   (VDGT,1USANOT) The experiment was performed at the     C2268  1   11 
           Nuclear Science Laboratory at Notre Dame with the FN   C2268  1   12 
           Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator                       C2268  1   13

DETECTOR   (MAGSP) Amount of produced reoiled 36Cl nuclei were    C2268  1   15

METHOD     After passing through the entrance foil, the  33S      C2268  1   18 
           beam reacted along the length of the gas-filled        C2268  1   19 
           volume and forward-recoiled 36Cl atoms were stopped    C2268  1   20 
           in a 0.25 mm thick Al foil at the back of the gas      C2268  1   21 
           cell. SRIM simulations shown that, for all energies,   C2268  1   22 
           more than 99% of recoils are caught in the 9 cm        C2268  1   23 
           diameter circular cross section of the foil.           C2268  1   24 
           (CHSEP) After irradiation chemical separation was      C2268  1   25

           (AMS) Atomic mass spectroscopy was used to determine   C2268  1   27 
           number of 36Cl nuclei produced. The AMS measurements   C2268  1   28 
           were normalized to the 36Cl standard material KNSTD500.C2268  1   29
