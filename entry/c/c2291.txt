FACILITY   (CYCTM,1USAMSU) The experiment was performed at the    C2291  1   12 
           Coupled-Cyclotron Facility of the National             C2291  1   13

SAMPLE     Liquid Hydrogen target was used. The liquid hydrogen   C2291  1   16 
           was contained by a cylindrical aluminum target cell    C2291  1   17 
           with 125 mu-m Kapton entrance and exit windows mounted C2291  1   18 
           on a cryocooler. The nominal target thickness was 30   C2291  1   19 
           mm.The effective thickness of the target was           C2291  1   20 
           determined to be 258 mg/cm2 and mid-target beam        C2291  1   21 
           energy was 91.5 MeV/nucleon.                           C2291  1   22 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Secondary beam particles were identified       C2291  1   23 
           upstream of the reaction target by energy loss in a    C2291  1   24
