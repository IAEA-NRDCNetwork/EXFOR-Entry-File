FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAANL) The foil stacks were exposed to the    C199600100012 
           deflected beam of the Argonne 60-in. cyclotron.        C199600100013 
DETECTOR   (NAICR) Gamma radiation from the 197Hg isomers were    C199600100014 
           detected with a 3in x 3in NaI(Tl) crystal connected    C199600100015 
           to a multichannel analyzer.In order to minimize the    C199600100016 
           magnitude of the sum peaks in counting the 134-keV     C199600100017 
           gamma, the samples were counted in a 3.7% geometry.    C199600100018 
CORRECTION Small correction for sum peak was applied.             C199600100019 
METHOD     (ACTIV) Activation method was used to determine        C199600100020 
             cross sections and isomeric ratios.                  C199600100021
