FACILITY   (LINAC,1USABRK) Experiment was performed by admitting  C199800100007 
           the linear accelerator proton beam directly into a     C199800100008 
           cloud chamber filled with helium.                      C199800100009 
SAMPLE     Helium gass in the cloud chamber                       C199800100010 
DETECTOR   Cloud chamber was used to detect charged particles.    C199800100011 
           Cloud-chamber technique was capable of associating     C199800100012 
           the inelastic protons with the various types of        C199800100013 
           reactions that produced them since particle ionization,C199800100014 
           momentum of charged particles, and the number of       C199800100015 
           charged particles per event could be determined.       C199800100016 
           The cloud chamber was mounted between a pair of        C199800100017 
           pulse-operated Helmholtz coils that produced a magneticC199800100018 
           field 7000 gauss transverse to the beam. The           C199800100019 
           sensitive volume of the cylindrical cloud chamber was  C199800100020 
            16 in. in diameter and 6 in. deep, and it contained   C199800100021 
            13 atmospheres of helium with water vapor. Pictures   C199800100022 
           were taken every 2 minutes.                            C199800100023
