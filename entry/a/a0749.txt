SAMPLE     Three pairs of CH2 and C targets 40 mm high and 35 mm  A0749  1   10 
           wide with areal densities ranging from about 300 to    A0749  1   11 
           800 mg/cm2 were used. Solid CH2-targets were used to   A0749  1   12 
           avoid the complications, occurring notably at low      A0749  1   13 
           pion energies, associated with a liquid hydrogen       A0749  1   14 
           target, such as the presence of windows, the control   A0749  1   15 
           and stability of the target volume and the             A0749  1   16 
           impossibility of a 4-PI-detector geometry. The carbon  A0749  1   17 
           background was subtracted in background runs on        A0749  1   18 
           graphite targets.                                      A0749  1   19 
METHOD     (TRN) The transmission experiments where the loss of   A0749  1   20 
           negative pions on a hydrogen target was recorded.      A0749  1   21 
DETECTOR   (SPEC) The detector for outgoing charged particles     A0749  1   22 
           was a carefully designed nearly full 4Pi scintillator  A0749  1   23 
           box 20 x 10 x 10 cm3 in size, consisting of six        A0749  1   24 
           scintillator plates, 2 mm thick with the exception of  A0749  1   25 
           the 'back' detector which was 7 mm thick, needed to    A0749  1   26 
           achieve very high efficiency. The only opening in this A0749  1   27 
           box was the beam entrancehole in the 'front' detector, A0749  1   28 
           3 x 3 cm2 in size which encompassed the beam           A0749  1   29 
           definition counter. All six detectors forming the box  A0749  1   30 
           were read out on two ends via lucite light guides.     A0749  1   31 
           Each detector was followed by an efficiency counter,   A0749  1   32 
           3 mm thick. The data acquisition system which          A0749  1   33 
           recorded the signals of all detectors for every        A0749  1   34 
           incoming negative pion and thus allowed an off-line    A0749  1   35 
           analysis on an event-by-event basis.                   A0749  1   36 
CORRECTION The resulting raw cross sections were corrected for theA0749  1   37 
            (false) detection of gammas (6 to 8%) and of neutrons A0749  1   38 
            (1 to 4%) and for Dalitz decays(1.2%) . Corrections   A0749  1   39 
           were also made for the decay of pions very close to    A0749  1   40 
           the target where the time-of-flight discrimination     A0749  1   41 
           was ineffective. Moreover, the known cross sections    A0749  1   42 
           for radiative pion capture (~0.7 mb) had to be         A0749  1   43 
           subtracted.                                            A0749  1   44
