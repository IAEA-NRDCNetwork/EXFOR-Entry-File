METHOD     (ASEP).The cesium isotopes produced in small quantitiesA0648  2    5 
           in the irradiated targets were separated directly      A0648  2    6 
           inside a surface ionization ion source of an           A0648  2    7 
           electromagnetic isotope separator.  In the apparatus   A0648  2    8 
           chemical separation was based upon the differences of  A0648  2    9 
           volatility and ionization potentials of the elements.  A0648  2   10 
           a first chemical separation took place in the oven     A0648  2   11 
           because of the volatility of these elements. A second  A0648  2   12 
           drastic separation occurred along the heated tantalum  A0648  2   13 
           pipe where only the alkali atoms were ionized.         A0648  2   14 
           an electric field accelerates these ions which are thenA0648  2   15 
           electromagnetically mass separated.  The tantalum was  A0648  2   16 
           selected as the ionizing surface because it is easily  A0648  2   17 
           machined though the electron work function  (W  =  4.19A0648  2   18 
           eV) is not very large;  nevertheless it is large enoughA0648  2   19 
           to ionize cesium atoms which present a low ionization  A0648  2   20 
           potential (W= 3.89 eV)                                 A0648  2   21

            (T1/2(g) = 2.1 Yr), the population of the two states  A0648  2   23 
           were determined directly by measuring the gamma        A0648  2   24 
           activity of 134-Cs, mass separated and collected  on  5A0648  2   25 
           mum-thin  aluminum foil.  In this case, the irradiated A0648  2   26 
           targets were immediately introduced in the graphite    A0648  2   27 
           crucible of the ion source and were progressively      A0648  2   28 
           brought to the melting temperature in order to         A0648  2   29 
           facilitate the diffusion of the alkali element.        A0648  2   30
