           Foil thickness and alpha particles flux were measured  A0139  1   26 
           and used to calculate production cross sections for    A0139  1   27 
           each of the active isotopes found in each foil.        A0139  1   28

SAMPLE     The lead foils were analyzed spectroscopically         A0139  1   30 
           for interfering impurities, the amounts of these       A0139  1   31 
           were found to be negligible. The stacks, used for      A0139  1   32 
           the determination of excitation functions and thick    A0139  1   33 
           target yields, were during the irradiations interlaid  A0139  1   34 
           by copper and aluminum foils.                          A0139  1   35 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Uncertainties in the cross-section values   A0139  1   36 
           were estimated by propagating in square the            A0139  1   37 
           contributions for both decay curve and peak analyses   A0139  1   38

           The eventual losses of reaction products by recoil wereA0139  1   42 
           assumed to be negligible.                              A0139  1   43 
           As for any reaction that might occur due to secondary  A0139  1   44 
           neutrons, additional foils were set up beyond the rangeA0139  1   45 
           of alpha particles. Spectra from those foils showed no A0139  1   46 
           significant contribution to the data.                  A0139  1   47 
CORRECTION  The areas of all gamma-peaks observed were corrected  A0139  1   48 
           for efficiency of detection and the activities         A0139  1   49 
           of the radioactive products were calculated separately A0139  1   50 
           for each peak on the basis of the nuclear data. No     A0139  1   51 
           corrections were made either for the energy spread at  A0139  1   52 
           each foil /as resulting from foil thickness variations/A0139  1   53 
           or for energy losses at the preceding foils.           A0139  1   54 
COMMENT     (By authors) No absolute beam energy determination    A0139  1   55 
           was performed in this experiment. On the basis of      A0139  1   56 
           other determinations of the external beam of Buenos    A0139  1   57 
           Aries synchrocyclotron, we assumed an energy of        A0139  1   58 
           55.0 MeV for alpha particles with an error of 0.55 MeV A0139  1   59 
           in each case the target stack was thick enough to stop A0139  1   60 
           the 55.0 MeV external alpha-beam. The uncertainty in   A0139  1   61 
           the incident particle energy for each data point       A0139  1   62 
           arises from the energy spread of the incident alpha-   A0139  1   63 
           particle beam as well as from the straggling energy    A0139  1   64 
           losses. Effective energy spreads of 0.5 MeV were       A0139  1   65 
           obtained for 10 MeV alpha-particles.                   A0139  1   66
