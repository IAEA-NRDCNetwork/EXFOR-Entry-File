SAMPLE     Targets of about 1 mg/cm**2 thickness were prepared by A0111  1   10 
           vacuum evaporation of natural rubidium chloride on     A0111  1   11 
           7 mg/cm**2 aluminium backing. The target thickness was A0111  1   12 
           measured by weighting the foils before and after       A0111  1   13 
           deposition of the target material. The target assembly A0111  1   14 
           consisted of a number of rubidium targets sandwiched   A0111  1   15 
           between aluminium catcher and degrader foils.          A0111  1   16

COMMENT    - By Authors - Natural rubidium contains about 27.8%   A0111  1   37 
           Rb-87. At some bombarding energies the same product    A0111  1   38 
           nucleus can therefore be formed from the two isotopes  A0111  1   39 
           Rb-85 and Rb-87 by different reaction channels. To     A0111  1   40 
           avoid any complication due to the presence Rb-87, the  A0111  1   41 
           alpha-energy range for any particular reaction channel A0111  1   42 
           was selected in such a way that Rb-87 could not        A0111  1   43 
           contribute significantly to the production of the      A0111  1   44 
           nucleus of interest.                                   A0111  1   45

COMMENT    - By Authors - In the case of Y-87, the half lives of  A0111  2    4 
           the isomeric state and ground state are comparable.    A0111  2    5 
           Therefore their yields were measured independently and A0111  2    6 
           from the sum of the yields of Y-87-g and Y-87-m, the   A0111  2    7 
           production cross section of Y-87 was determined.       A0111  2    8
