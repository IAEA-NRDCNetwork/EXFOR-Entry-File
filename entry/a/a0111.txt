COMMENT    - By Authors - In the Case of Y-87, the Half Lives of  A011100200004 
           The Isomeric State and Ground State are Comparable.    A011100200005 
           Therefore Their Yields were Measured Independently and A011100200006 
           From the Sum of the Yields of Y-87-G and Y-87-M, the   A011100200007 
           Production Cross Section of Y-87 was Determined.       A011100200008
