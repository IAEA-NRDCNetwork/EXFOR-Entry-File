           The incident Ca-48 ion beam was grazed the lateral faceA001600100013 
           of a rotating hollow cylinder. This surface  was       A001600100014 
           covered by a thin (about 2-mg/cm**2) layer of the      A001600100015 
           target material deposited by vacuum vaporization. In   A001600100016 
           this geometry the target is considered to be           A001600100017 
            infinitely  thick for the ion beam and recoil  nuclei A001600100018 
           and, at the same time, sufficiently thin for an        A001600100019 
           efficient detection of the fragment of spontaneously   A001600100020 
           fissioning reaction products. Thus the cylinder        A001600100021 
           surface served both as a target and a recoil catcher.  A001600100022 
           The cylinder rotation transported the nuclei to Mica   A001600100023 
           fission  track  detectors  placed  along  the  cylinderA001600100024 
           surface, and set a time scale for measuring spontaneousA001600100025 
           fission half-lives. During the  experiments,  the  ion A001600100026 
           beam  intensity  was  controlled  by  a  special deviceA001600100027 
           placed outside the target. The integral ion  beam  was A001600100028 
           determined  using an activation analysis method, namelyA001600100029 
           from the build-up of a long-lived  activity  in  an    A001600100030
