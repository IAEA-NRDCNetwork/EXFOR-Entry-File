FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAMIN) The 50 MeV cyclotron.                  A1261  1   10 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Five Ne-102 plastic scintillators were used.    A1261  1   11 
           (CSICR) One CsI(Na) scintillator was used.             A1261  1   12 
SAMPLE     The gas target cells have walls formed by a thick brassA1261  1   13 
           cylinder and each cell has a beam entrance and a beam  A1261  1   14 
           exit foil soldered in place and composed of Ni. The    A1261  1   15 
           entrance foils are 0.02 mm thick and the exit foils,   A1261  1   16 
           having a large area than the entrance foils, are 0.07  A1261  1   17 
           mm thick. Two cells of different lengths were used     A1261  1   18 
           during the experiments. One cell of length t=3.10 cm   A1261  1   19 
           was operated at a pressure of about 35 atm, and the    A1261  1   20 
           other of length t=5.16 cm was operated at a pressure ofA1261  1   21 
           about 20 atm.                                          A1261  1   22
