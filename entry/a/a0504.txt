COMMENT    -  By  authors. Considering the different half-lives ofA050400200028 
           the neutron-rich Hg isotopes two different experimentalA050400200029 
           arrangements, A and B, were used.                      A050400200030 
           1. Group A:  Every sample collected the separated Hg   A050400200031 
           isotopes produced during a target irradiation duration A050400200032 
           of 120 sec.  After shutting off the beam the sample wasA050400200033 
           automatically transported to a low-background          A050400200034 
           measurement area -50 m away from the online target     A050400200035 
           device within 15-20 sec.  Then the sample was put into A050400200036 
           the  measurement position and the detection was startedA050400200037 
           at, on the average, 45 sec after irradiation.  The     A050400200038 
           measurement  lasted 420 sec.  The data were recorded onA050400200039 
           time-successive multispectrum modes and the single and A050400200040 
           the filtered gamma-ray spectra were simultaneously     A050400200041 
           recorded for each 20-sec time bin.  A total of 143 suchA050400200042 
           cycles were performed.                                 A050400200043 
           2.  Group B:  The irradiation duration is 90-100 min.  A050400200044 
           The measurements started at 8 min after irradiation.   A050400200045 
           The spectrum measurements lasted about 100 min.  Three A050400200046 
           such samples were measured.  Only the last sample was  A050400200047 
           measured for 44 hours.  The time bins used for         A050400200048 
           group B were, in order, 5 min during the first hour, 20A050400200049 
           min during the second and third hours, and 2 hours     A050400200050
