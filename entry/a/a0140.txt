SAMPLE     Natural iron was soldered on to a copper backing and   A0140  1   11 
           bombarded with an extracted beam of 100 microampere    A0140  1   12

COMMENT    /By authors/.Ni-57 and Co-55 for the labelling of      A0140  1   14 
           bleomycin were produced by bombardment of natural      A0140  1   15 
           iron with 25 MeV helium-3. The thick target yields     A0140  1   16 
           were 32 muci/muahr of Ni-57 and 21 muci/muahr of       A0140  1   17 
           Co-55 of 25 MeV helium-3.the bleomycin was successfullyA0140  1   18 
           labelled with the carrier-free isotopes.               A0140  1   19

COMMENT    /By authors/ Ni-57 can most easily be produced by      A0140  2    7 
           helium-3 bombardment of natural iron by the reaction   A0140  2    8 
           Fe-56(He3,2n)Ni-57 the occurrence of Fe-56 in natural  A0140  2    9 
           iron being 92%. Ni-56 can Be produced by the           A0140  2   10 
            (alpha,2n) reaction on Fe-54,but since natural iron   A0140  2   11 
           contains less than 6% of this isotope the helium-3     A0140  2   12 
           reaction on Fe-56 was preferred. However, since the    A0140  2   13 
           decay scheme of Ni-56 is more favorable for medical    A0140  2   14 
           work it will later replace the Ni-57 in this experimentA0140  2   15

COMMENT    /By authors/.Co-55 is easier and cheaper to produce    A0140  3   11 
           than Co-57 it was also decided to produced this        A0140  3   12 
           isotope and tag it on to bleomycin.                    A0140  3   13
