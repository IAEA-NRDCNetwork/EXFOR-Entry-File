SAMPLE     An existing target of 7-Li/F, having 99.9% enrichment  A058900100015 
           of 7-Li, was used.  The target was of thickness ~80    A058900100016 
           microgramm/cm**2, evaporated onto a ~35                A058900100017 
           microgramm/cm**2 carbon backing.  A very thin layer of A058900100018 
           Au (~4 microgramm/cm**2) was deposited on the target   A058900100019 
           for beam dose and solid angle normalisation.  The      A058900100020 
           composition of the target was determined by elastic    A058900100021 
           recoil detection analysis using a 58-Ni beam of energy A058900100022 
           60 MeV, which is less than half the Coulomb barrier    A058900100023 
           energy for all target components.  In terms of number  A058900100024 
           of nuclei/cm2, the abundance of the various target     A058900100025 
           components relative to 7-Li were measured to be:       A058900100026 
           Li:F:C:O:Au                                            A058900100027

           the ions entering the detector was measured using a 21 A058900100033 
           cm long grid electrode, whilst the energy loss signal  A058900100034 
           was obtained from a separate 3.2 cm long anode.        A058900100035

COMMENT    - By authors. It needs to be emphasized here that this A058900200008 
           cross-section, excluding evaporated residues having    A058900200009 
           kinetic energies below 4 MeV and also excluding the    A058900200010 
           evaporated residues C and B, is indeed the lower limit A058900200011 
           to the fusion cross-section at this energy.            A058900200012 
           To compare with gamma-ray measurements, an estimate is A058900200013 
           needed of the cross-sections of evaporated residues    A058900200014 
           with kinetic energies below 4 MeV, not available from  A058900200015 
           the present measurement.  Statistical model            A058900200016 
           calculations performed using the code PACE, which      A058900200017 
           reproduces the energy and angular dependence of the    A058900200018 
           evaporated residues, predicted the contribution of     A058900200019 
           evaporated residues below 4 MeV to be 20% of the total A058900200020 
           fusion cross-section.  However, to take into account   A058900200021 
           the possible dependence of the calculation on the      A058900200022 
           various parameters in the code, this contribution belowA058900200023 
           4 MeV has been taken to be (20+/-8)%, where the        A058900200024 
           uncertainty has been estimated very conservatively.    A058900200025
