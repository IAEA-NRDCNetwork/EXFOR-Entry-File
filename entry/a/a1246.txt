DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SIBAR) Proton recoil. The neutron angular A1246  1   17 
           distribution was measured with a proton recoil         A1246  1   18 
           telescope counter. In this counter protons are         A1246  1   19 
           scattered out of a polyethylene foil 43 mg/cm3         A1246  1   20 
           thick and detected by a CsI crystal a transmission     A1246  1   21 
           Au-Si surface barrier detector 300 um thick is         A1246  1   22 
           inserted between foil and crystal. To reduce the       A1246  1   23 
           background the pulse height spectrum of the CsI        A1246  1   24 
           crystal is gated by the coincidence pulse of two       A1246  1   25 
           counters. In this was the background counting rate     A1246  1   26 
           measured without the polythene foil was only about 3%  A1246  1   27 
           of the counting rate obtained with the foil in         A1246  1   28 
           position. At a deuteron energy of 1 MeV the neutrons   A1246  1   29 
           were monitored by the associated alpha particle        A1246  1   30 
           method, and at deuteron of 1.5 and 2 MeV by two Au-Si  A1246  1   31 
           surface barrier detectors. The monitors were mounted   A1246  1   32 
           12 cm from the target at an angle of 140 degr.         A1246  1   33
