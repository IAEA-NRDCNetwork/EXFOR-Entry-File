DETECTOR   (TELES) Proton recoil. The neutron angular distributionA124600100013 
           was measured with a proton recoil telescope counter. InA124600100014 
           this counter protons are scattered out of a polyethyle-A124600100015 
           ne foil 43 mg/cm**3 thick and detected by a CsI crystalA124600100016 
           a transmission Au-Si surface barrier detector 300mu-m  A124600100017

           the background the pulse height spectrum of the CsI    A124600100019 
           crystal is gated by the coincidence pulse of two coun- A124600100020

           monitored by the associated alpha particle method, and A124600100025 
           at deuteron of 1.5 and 2 MeV by two Au-Si surface      A124600100026
