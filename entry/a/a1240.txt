SAMPLE     The cells were filled with high-purity gases (3He      A124000100010 
           nominally 99.9%) isotopically and chemically pure,     A124000100011

DETECTOR   (GELI,NAICR) The cells were counted with a large Ge(Li)A124000100013 
           detector whose nominal efficiency at 1333 keV was 22%  A124000100014

           at 25 cm, and whose resolution was 1.3 keV at 478 keV. A124000100016
