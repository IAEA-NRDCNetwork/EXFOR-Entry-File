COMMENT    -By authors.  The cross sections of investigated       A070900100012 
           reactions could be investigated using Pt targets of    A070900100013 
           natural isotopic composition, containing 7.2% 198-Pt.  A070900100014 
           As 198-Pt is the heaviest of the stable Pt isotopes theA070900100015 
           investigated products can be formed only via reactions A070900100016 
           on 198-Pt.                                             A070900100017

METHOD     (GSPEC) The spectra were measured two or three times:  A070900100019 
           a few hours after EOB and after a few weeks in a       A070900100020 
           low-background chamber at large source to detector     A070900100021 
           distances, to minimize pile up- and coincidence losses.A070900100022

ERR-ANALYS (EN-ERR) The uncertainties of the calculated energies  A070900100025 
           were estimated from the uncertainty of the energy of   A070900100026 
           the primary incident beam, the uncertainties of the    A070900100027 
           target thickness taking into account the well known    A070900100028 
           energy straggling effect and other cumulative effects  A070900100029 
           of the used stacked-foil technique.                    A070900100030 
           (DATA-ERR)  The  estimation of the standard uncertaintyA070900100031 
           was performed as required by the Guide of InternationalA070900100032 
           organisation of Standards, neglecting the uncertaintiesA070900100033 
           of the non linear contributions (time, half-life,      A070900100034 
           etc.).  The total uncertainties are in the range of    A070900100035 
           11%-13 %.                                              A070900100036
