COMMENT    Abstract.  Fusion cross sections were measured for     A045300100009 
           the 6,7-Li+27-Al, 64-Zn systems, at energies above the A045300100010 
           the coulomb barrier, in order to study the influence ofA045300100011 
           the breakup of stable weakly bound nuclei on the fusionA045300100012 
           process.  The analysis was completed by the inclusion  A045300100013 
           of the data of fusion induced by 9-Be and the strongly A045300100014 
           bound 16-O and 11-B projectiles on the same targets.   A045300100015 
           The fusion excitation functions have similar behavior  A045300100016 
           for all projectiles incident on both targets and they  A045300100017 
           show no indication of fusion hindrance.                A045300100018 
           - By authors:.The masses of residual nuclei originatingA045300100019 
           from the complete fusion and those from the incomplete A045300100020 
           fusion are mostly the same, and we were not able to    A045300100021 
           separate complete fusion from incomplete fusion.       A045300100022 
           Therefore, the measured fusion cross sections          A045300100023 
           correspond to the sum of these two proccesses.         A045300100024
