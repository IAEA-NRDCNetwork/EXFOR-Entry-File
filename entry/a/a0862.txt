INC-SOURCE (SPALL) The inelastic cross section of relativistic    A086200100016 
           protons in Pb was determined indirectly by measuring   A086200100017 
           the neutron distribution along a Lead spallation       A086200100018 
           neutron source.                                        A086200100019 
           The spallation neutron source was irradiated by 1, 1.5 A086200100020 
           and 2 GeV protons. The experimental results were       A086200100021 
           obtained using passive methods. By the use of the beam A086200100022 
           attenuation coefficient, deduced by a fitting procedureA086200100023 
           of experimental data, the inelastic cross section of   A086200100024 
           protons in Pb was determined.                          A086200100025 
SAMPLE     A cylindrical Pb target, with 40 cm length and 8 cm in A086200100026 
           diameter covered with a paraffin moderator 6 cm in     A086200100027 
           thickness.                                             A086200100028 
DETECTOR   (TRD) The neutron distribution was studied on the      A086200100029 
           paraffin moderator a long the target by using Solid    A086200100030 
           State Nuclear Track Detectors(SSNTDs).                 A086200100031 
           Natural Cd foils (mass approx.2 gram, purity 99.9%,    A086200100032 
           thickness 1 mm) were also used as an activation        A086200100033 
           detector.                                              A086200100034 
COMMENT    *By author*.Each part of the neutron spectrum was      A086200100035 
           measured by using two different techniques.            A086200100036 
           Neutron fluencies are presented for three neutron      A086200100037 
           energy ranges. Thermal neutrons with En < 1 eV, slow   A086200100038 
            (1 eV < En < 10 keV) and fast neutrons                A086200100039 
            (0.3 MeV < En < 3 MeV) are shown for an irradiation ofA086200100040 
           the target with protons of 1 GeV. Slow neutrons were   A086200100041 
           measured by Cd-nat activation method while thermal     A086200100042 
           neutrons with En < 1 eV and fast neutrons by SSNTDs    A086200100043 
           technique.                                             A086200100044
