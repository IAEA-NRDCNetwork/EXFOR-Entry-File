COMMENT    -By  Author:   We report excitation function for the   A0296  1   10 
           reaction 130-Te(p,n)130-I in the energy range 4-18 MeV A0296  1   11 
           The measurements were done employing slacked foil      A0296  1   12 
           activation technique and enriched isotope. To the best A0296  1   13 
           of our knowledge this excitation function has been     A0296  1   14 
           reported for the first time.  The theoretical analysis A0296  1   15 
           of the excitation function has been done employing bothA0296  1   16 
           the semiclassical as well as quantum mechanical        A0296  1   17 
           descriptions of the pre-equilibrium emission.  In      A0296  1   18 
           general, theoretical calculations agree well with ihe  A0296  1   19 
           experimental data.                                     A0296  1   20

SAMPLE     (52-TE-130,ENR=0.61) An enriched isotope (61%) of      A0296  1   28 
           Te-130 was used for preparing the samples, which       A0296  1   29 
           were made by vacuum evaporation, of 1.1 mg/cm2         A0296  1   30 
           thickness on aluminum backing of 6.75 mg/cm2. The      A0296  1   31 
           square pieces of targets of size 1.2x1.2 cm2 were      A0296  1   32 
           used as samples in the stack. Each target was mounted  A0296  1   33 
           individually on a conducting metal frame for heat      A0296  1   34 
           dissipation. A stack for irradiation was made by       A0296  1   35 
           taking seven targets with aluminum foils of suitable   A0296  1   36 
           thickness as degraders.                                A0296  1   37
