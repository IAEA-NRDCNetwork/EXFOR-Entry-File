           The Measurements were done Employing Slacked Foil      A029600100011 
           Activation Technique and Enriched Isotope. To the Best A029600100012 
           Of Our Knowledge this Excilation Function has Been     A029600100013 
           Reported For the First Time.  The Theoretical Analysis A029600100014 
           Of the Excitation Function has Been done Employing BothA029600100015

           Were Made by Vacuum Evaporation, of 1.1                A029600100029 
           Milligramm/Cm**2  Thickness on Aluminum Backing of 6.75A029600100030 
           Milligramm/Cm**2.  The Square Pieces of Targets of SizeA029600100031 
           1.2X1.2 Cm2 were Used As Samples in the Stack.  Each   A029600100032 
           Target was Mounted Individually on a Conducting Metal  A029600100033 
           Frame  For  Heat  Dissipation.  A Stack For IrradiationA029600100034 
           Was Made by Taking Seven Targets with Aluminum Foils ofA029600100035

           (ERR-T) The Errors May be Due to the Factors:          A029600100041 
           1. The Statistical Error of Gamma Counting             A029600100042 
           2. The Uncertainty in the Determination of the Number  A029600100043 
           Of Target Nuclei. The Errors Estimated to be <1%.      A029600100044 
           3. During the Irradiation the Beam Current Often       A029600100045 
           Fluctuates, Which Result in Variation of the Incident  A029600100046 
           Flux. It is Expected That the Beam Flux Fluctuation MayA029600100047 
           Introduce Errors of <3%.                               A029600100048 
           4. The Uncertaities in the Efficiency of the           A029600100049 
           Detector are Estimated to be < 8%.                     A029600100050 
           5. The Error in the Measured Cross Section Due to the  A029600100051 
           Maximum Beam Intensity Loss at the End of the Stack wasA029600100052 
           Estimated to be < 1.5%                                 A029600100053
