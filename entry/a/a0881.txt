DETECTOR   (HPGE) HPGe detectors with an energy resolution of     A0881005    6 
           approx. 1.2 keV for E(g)=662 keV were used in the      A0881005    7 
           measurements.                                          A0881005    8 
FACILITY   (VDGT,4ZZZDUB) A 6He beam was obtained at the DRIBs    A0881005    9 
           accelerator complex for radioactive beams, which is a  A0881005   10 
           tandem of two accelerators U-400M and U-400 (ISOL).    A0881005   11 
SAMPLE     The target stack consisted of six Sc foils with        A0881005   12 
           thicknesses of 3 to 5 um. The first stack was          A0881005   13 
           irradiated with a calculated 6He energy of 20 MeV.     A0881005   14 
           A stack of three Sc foils was irradiated by a 6He beam A0881005   15 
           with an energy of ions incident on the stack of about  A0881005   16 
            23 MeV.                                               A0881005   17 
           In both arrays, Al foils with different thicknesses    A0881005   18 
           were placed between the Sc targets to measure the 6He  A0881005   19 
           energy.                                                A0881005   20
