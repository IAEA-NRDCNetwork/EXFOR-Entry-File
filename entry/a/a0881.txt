           A stack of three Sc foils was irradiated by a 6He beam A088100400019 
           with an energy of ions incident on the stack of about  A088100400020 
            23 MeV.                                               A088100400021 
           In both arrays, Al foils with different thicknesses    A088100400022 
           were placed between the Sc targets to measure the 6He  A088100400023 
           energy.                                                A088100400024
