           scattering, the yields for the angular distributions atA090700100025 
           the energies of 593.0 and 746.4 keV for angles smaller A090700100026 
           than 60 degree were normalized to the Rutherford cross A090700100027 
           section.                                               A090700100028 
SAMPLE     A layer of lithium, enriched to 96.9% in the isotope   A090700100029 
           Li-6 was deposited onto a backing aluminum oxide(Al2O3)A090700100030 
           film obtained by the electrolytic method. A target in  A090700100031 
           which the thickness of the backing (Al2O3) was         A090700100032 
           approximately identical to the thickness of the lithiumA090700100033 
           oxide film (about 30 mug/cm**2) was manufactured.      A090700100034 
CORRECTION The laboratory energy was corrected with allowance for A090700100035 
           energy losses undergone by the protons traversing the  A090700100036 
           lithium oxide film and the backing.                    A090700100037
