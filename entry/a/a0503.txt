SAMPLE     Targets used in this measurement were 0.5 mg/cm**2 to  A050300100008 
           1.5 mg/cm**2 thick and were prepared by                A050300100009 
           electro-deposition on ~1 mg/cm**2 Cu backings. Target  A050300100010 
           thickness values were estimated by measuring RutherfordA050300100011 
           scattering.                                            A050300100012 
           Relative thickness values of different targets were    A050300100013 
           also checked by measuring X-ray induced fluorescence.  A050300100014 
           While 192-Os targets were 99% enriched, 188-Os targets A050300100015 
           had the following isotopic composition, 86.7% 188-Os,  A050300100016 
           9.51% 189-Os, 2.46% 190-Os, and 1.33% 192-Os.          A050300100017
