SAMPLE     Each packet contained a number of 1.268-cm diameter    A0137001   13 
           monitor, target, and recoil-catcher foils. Elemental   A0137001   14 
           Al, with a purity of 99.997% and thickness             A0137001   15 
           26 um was used for beam monitors and forward           A0137001   16 
           and backward recoil catchers. A catcher foil was       A0137001   17 
           placed both upstream and downstream of each target     A0137001   18 
           to determine recoil loss corrections, and monitors     A0137001   19 
           were situated likewise to measure any loss of beam     A0137001   20 
           intensity upon traversal of the experimental packet.   A0137001   21 
           All Al monitors were, of course, fully compensated.    A0137001   22 
           High-purity (>=99.9%) elemental targets of             A0137001   23 
           La, Mo, and V were irradiated, and an entire packet    A0137001   24 
           was sandwiched together and maintained at a constant   A0137001   25 
           position in the proton beam with an external holder.   A0137001   26 
           While each packet contained a single La and Mo foil,   A0137001   27 
           three adjacent V targets were incorporated. In this    A0137001   28 
           way, the cross sections for nuclides such as 24-Na,    A0137001   29 
           22-Na, and 7-Be, which are also produced in and        A0137001   30 
           recoil from the Al catchers, could be determined by    A0137001   31 
           analyzing the central V target.                        A0137001   32 
            Two independent bombardments were performed.          A0137001   33 
           In the first, the thickness of each of the targets was A0137001   34 
           approximately 0.05 mm, while in the second 0.25 mm     A0137001   35 
           was typical. Such a procedure allowed the study of     A0137001   36 
           individual cross sections as a function of target      A0137001   37 
           thickness in order to correct for any possible         A0137001   38 
           production via secondary reactions.                    A0137001   39
