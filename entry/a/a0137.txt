SAMPLE     Each packet contained a number of 1.268-cm diameter    A0137  1   13 
           monitor,target, and recoil-catcher foils. Elemental    A0137  1   14 
           Al, with a purity of 99.997% and thickness             A0137  1   15 
           26 mu was used for beam monitors and forward           A0137  1   16 
           and backward recoil catchers. A catcher foil was       A0137  1   17 
           placed both upstream and downstream of each target     A0137  1   18 
           to determine recoil loss corrections, and monitors     A0137  1   19 
           were situated likewise to measure any loss of beam     A0137  1   20 
           intensity upon traversal of the experimental packet.   A0137  1   21 
           All Al monitors were, of course, fully compensated.    A0137  1   22 
           High-purity (>=99.9%) elemental targets of             A0137  1   23 
           La, Mo, and V were irradiated, and an entire packet    A0137  1   24 
           was sandwiched together and maintained at a constant   A0137  1   25 
           position in the proton beam with an external holder.   A0137  1   26 
           While each packet contained a single La and Mo foil,   A0137  1   27 
           three adjacent V targets were incorporated. In this    A0137  1   28 
           way, the cross sections for nuclides such as 24-Na,    A0137  1   29 
           22-Na, and 7-Fe, which are also produced in and        A0137  1   30 
           recoil from the Al catchers, could be determined by    A0137  1   31 
           analyzing the central V target.                        A0137  1   32 
            Two independent bombardments were performed.          A0137  1   33 
           In the first, the thickness of each of the targets was A0137  1   34 
           approximately 0.05 mm, while in the second 0.25 mm     A0137  1   35 
           was typical. Such a procedure allowed the study of     A0137  1   36 
           individual cross sections as a function of target      A0137  1   37 
           thickness in order to correct for any possible         A0137  1   38 
           production via secondary reactions.                    A0137  1   39

COMMENT     (By authors) The reported cross sections are based    A0137  1   44 
           only upon the 22-Na and 7-Be monitor reactions in Al.  A0137  1   45 
           While these monitors gave comparable results, cross    A0137  1   46 
           sections calculated relative to 24-Na production       A0137  1   47 
           were observed to be consistently 10-20%                A0137  1   48 
             Although this is the correct direction for           A0137  1   49 
           possible secondary interferences in this monitor       A0137  1   50 
           reaction (primarily from the fast-neutron induced      A0137  1   51 
           27-Al(n,alpha)24-Na reaction, our results are not      A0137  1   52 
           compatible with the expected secondary rate, nor       A0137  1   53 
           did we observe any appreciable differences in          A0137  1   54
