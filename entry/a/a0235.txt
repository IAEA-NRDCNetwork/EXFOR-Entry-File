           The proton irradiations were performed on the          A0235  1   11 
           Brookhaven tandem van de Graaff accelerator. Typically A0235  1   12 
           the irradiations were for 1.5-3.0 minutes duration     A0235  1   13 
           and the beam currents were 100-300 nA. The specific    A0235  1   14 
           details pertaining to the beam energy analysis, the    A0235  1   15 
           beam focusing and collimator system, and Faraday cup   A0235  1   16 
           have been reported previously see 'REL-REF'. The       A0235  1   17 
           defocused proton beam was directed through a 1 cm      A0235  1   18 
           collimator which had permanent magnets installed to    A0235  1   19 
           suppress the secondary electrons produced in the       A0235  1   20 
           collimator.                                            A0235  1   21 
SAMPLE     The beam passed through a thin (5.46 mg/cm2,           A0235  1   22 
           1/4 mil, 6.4 um) Havar foil, a small air path          A0235  1   23 
            (~ 1.5 mg/cm2) and a Havar target window              A0235  1   24 
            (6.44 mg/cm2) before entering the target gas. The     A0235  1   25 
           total charge collected by the Faraday cup for each     A0235  1   26 
           run was determined with calibrated current             A0235  1   27 
           integrators. The target gas consisted of 91.7%         A0235  1   28 
           enriched 18O-2 with a gross composition of 99.8% mole  A0235  1   29 
           oxygen. The impurities consisted of 4.0% 17O and       A0235  1   30 
           4.3% 16O in the form of either O-2 or CO-2. The CO-2   A0235  1   31 
           and N-2 impurities were less 0.1% each.                A0235  1   32 
            The target chamber was constructed of Al and had      A0235  1   33 
           valved filling ports. The cylindrical chamber was      A0235  1   34 
           2.0 cm deep and 2.5 cm in diameter. Target pressures   A0235  1   35 
           ranged between 200 and 600 Torr. The targets were      A0235  1   36 
           loaded by way of a vacuum line equipped with a         A0235  1   37 
           Barocell differential pressure transducer.             A0235  1   38 
           A preliminary experiment indicated that less than 0.1% A0235  1   39 
           of the total activity remained in the gas phase in the A0235  1   40 
           Al targets. This was determined by passing the         A0235  1   41 
           irradiated 18O2 target gas through a charcoal trap     A0235  1   42 
           at liquid n2 temperature and counting the activity     A0235  1   43 
           trapped. In subsequent irradiations the gas was vented A0235  1   44 
           and the target opened for removal of the 18F activity. A0235  1   45
