SAMPLE     Two silicon samples cut out of a silicon wafer with    A062600100013 
           orientation (100) were used as substrates.  A thin     A062600100014 
           film  of alpha-Si-C:H was deposited simultaneously ontoA062600100015 
           these two substrates by means of plasma enhanced       A062600100016 
           chemical vapor deposition.  The standards were         A062600100017 
           transferred in air to the analysis chamber, in which   A062600100018 
           the typical pressure was 2e-8 mbar during the analysis.A062600100019 
           The composition of the Si-C:H film was measured by     A062600100020 
           means of Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy on the A062600100021 
           Si-C:H film.  The measured ratio was Si/C =0.50.       A062600100022 
           The stability of hydrogen contents during the          A062600100023 
           bombardment with high energy He-3 beam was verified.   A062600100024 
           Prior to the cross section measurement of the          A062600100025 
            H-1(HE3,P)2-He-3 Reaction, a Very Thin Layer of Gold  A062600100026 
           2.86*10e+15 atoms/cm**2 was evaporated on the          A062600100027 
           standard in order to normalize the results.            A062600100028 
DETECTOR   (SOLST).Three detectors were placed in the analyzing   A062600100029 
           chamber pumped down with a turbomolecular pump and the A062600100030 
           residual pressure was lower than 5*10e-7 mbar.         A062600100031 
           The first detector, named 'erd', was placed at 100 mm  A062600100032 
           from the beam impact at 20 or 30 degrees relative to   A062600100033 
           the incident beam.                                     A062600100034 
           The second surface barrier detector, named 'nra', was  A062600100035 
           placed 70 mm from the beam impact at 90 degree relativeA062600100036 
           to the incident beam.                                  A062600100037 
           The third detector (PIPS), labeled RBS and placed at   A062600100038 
           the backscattering angle of 140 degree, was used to    A062600100039 
           measured the integrated beam charge with the signal dueA062600100040
