SAMPLE     Two silicon samples cut out of a silicon wafer with    A0626  1   10 
           orientation (100) were used as substrates. A thin      A0626  1   11 
           film of alpha-Si-C:H was deposited simultaneously onto A0626  1   12 
           these two substrates by means of plasma enhanced       A0626  1   13 
           chemical vapor deposition. The standards were          A0626  1   14 
           transferred in air to the analysis chamber, in which   A0626  1   15 
           the typical pressure was 2E-8 mbar during the analysis.A0626  1   16 
           The composition of the Si-C:H film was measured by     A0626  1   17 
           means of Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy on the A0626  1   18 
           Si-C:H film. The measured ratio was Si/C =0.50.        A0626  1   19 
           The stability of hydrogen contents during the          A0626  1   20 
           bombardment with high energy He-3 beam was verified.   A0626  1   21 
           Prior to the cross section measurement of the          A0626  1   22 
           H-1(He3,p)2-He-3 reaction, a very thin layer of gold   A0626  1   23 
           2.86*10E+15 atoms/cm**2 was evaporated on the          A0626  1   24 
           standard in order to normalize the results.            A0626  1   25 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Three detectors were placed in the analyzing   A0626  1   26 
           chamber pumped down with a turbomolecular pump and the A0626  1   27 
           residual pressure was lower than 5*10E-7 mbar.         A0626  1   28 
           The first detector was placed at 100 mm from the beam  A0626  1   29 
           impact at 20 or 30 degrees relative to the incident    A0626  1   30 
           beam.                                                  A0626  1   31 
           The second surface barrier detector was placed 70 mm   A0626  1   32 
           from the beam impact at 90 degree relative to the      A0626  1   33 
           incident beam.                                         A0626  1   34 
           The third detector placed at the backscattering angle  A0626  1   35 
           of 140 degree, was used to measured the integrated beamA0626  1   36 
           charge with the signal due to the evaporated layer     A0626  1   37 
           of gold on the standard.                               A0626  1   38
