           and multiple scattering contribution, and from         G000500100042 
           uncertainties in the photon flux normalization and     G000500100043 
           in the absolute cross sections, were estimated to be   G000500100044

           -the photons were collimated and neutron filtered      G000500100046 
           in a tangential beam port, and a parallel beam,        G000500100047

           obtained at the target position.                       G000500100049 
           -the dimensions of the target were selected on the     G000500100050 
           basis of a monte carlo calculation which evaluated     G000500100051 
           the effect of neutron multiple scattering on the       G000500100052 
           peak areas. This was found to be less than 1 percent,  G000500100053 
           reflecting the high resolution of the present system.  G000500100054 
           -the experimental setup was tested for systematic      G000500100055 
           asymmetries by measuring the angular distribution of   G000500100056 
           neutron groups emitted from known isolated resonances, G000500100057 
           which, due to their defined spin and parity, should    G000500100058 
           be symmetric around 90 deg. the system was found to    G000500100059 
           be symmetric to within +- 3 percent.                   G000500100060 
           -because of the angular energy variation of the        G000500100061 
           emitted neutrons (i.e., fo E(gamma) = 9 MeV,           G000500100062 
           E(n)(40 deg.) - E(n)(140 deg) approx. 600 keV), a      G000500100063 
           correction was introduced to take into account the     G000500100064 
           change of the detector efficiency with energy. this    G000500100065 
           was done with use of a relative efficiency curve,      G000500100066 
           obtained from a Monte Carlo calculation for the He-3   G000500100067 
           spectrometer, at the present geometry. The calculation G000500100068 
           was tested against a measurement of the relative       G000500100069 
           efficiency for neutron energies of 0.1 to 2.77 MeV,    G000500100070 
           and was found to reproduce the experimental efficiency G000500100071 
           to within 5 percent.                                   G000500100072 
MONITOR    (1-H-2(G,N)1-H-1,,SIG) absolute diff. cross sections   G000500100073 
           were obtained from the measured angular distributions  G000500100074

MONIT-REF  (,Birenbaum+,J,PR/C,32,1825,1985) in which             G000500100076 
           the total D(g,n) cross section was obtained with an    G000500100077 
           accuracy generally better than 3 percent.              G000500100078 
           -at energies not studied by the above measurement by   G000500100079 
           Y.Birenbaum et. al, an interpolation was made using a  G000500100080 
           smooth exponential function which reproduced the       G000500100081 
           exp. cross sections to within 0.5 percent.             G000500100082
