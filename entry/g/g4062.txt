INC-SOURCE (TAGD,POLPS)  The  polarized photon beam was generated G406200100012 
           at process of coherent bremsstrahlung of electrons in aG406200100013 
           diamond crystal. The crystal was orientated in such a  G406200100014 
           way that main contribution to the coherent             G406200100015 
           bremsstrahlung cross section gave one vector of the    G406200100016 
           reciprocal lattice of the  crystal, [0-22] for parallelG406200100017 
           and [0-2-2] for perpendicular directions of the        G406200100018 
           polarization to the reaction plane.                    G406200100019 
SAMPLE     The measurements were performed using a CD2 plate of   G406200100020 
           1 mm thick, and a 1.1 mm CH2 target for the carbon     G406200100021 
           disintegration background subtraction. The targets     G406200100022 
           were positioned on the distance ~2 m from the photon   G406200100023 
           collimator at angle 60 degrees to the photon beam      G406200100024 
           direction.                                             G406200100025 
DETECTOR   (TELES,CSICR,SISD) Protons were detected by a CsI/SSD  G406200100026 
           telescope, placed under angle THETAp= 90 degees to the G406200100027 
           beam axis. It consisted of two identical single-sided  G406200100028 
           silicon strip detectors and a CsI(Tl) counter, which   G406200100029 
           functioned as delta E and E detectors, respectively.   G406200100030 
           The SSDs had a thickness of 0.5 mm and 64 strips,      G406200100031 
           which were paralleled in groups of two for the         G406200100032 
           read-out, thus yielding an effective strip width of 2  G406200100033 
           mm. The CsI(Tl) detector was of cylinder shape of      G406200100034 
           12.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm long. Its angular        G406200100035 
           acceptance was determined by Monte Carlo simulation,   G406200100036 
           using the GEANT-4 package, and was deltaTHETAp +-14    G406200100037 
           degrees FWHM. The proton detection threshold was Eth   G406200100038 
           18 MeV that corresponded to the photon energy of Eg    G406200100039 
           40 MeV for the d(g,p)n reaction.                       G406200100040
