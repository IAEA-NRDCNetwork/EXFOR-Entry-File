MONITOR    the photon dose was measured using a thin-walled       G001200100011

           arranged on two concentric rings, each of eight tubes. G001200100019 
           the neutron detection efficiency was determined from   G001200100020 
           measurements using calibrated neutron sources and a    G001200100021 
           measurement of the d(gamma,p)n reaction cross section. G001200100022 
METHOD     (EXTB) 37 independent yield curves were collected at   G001200100023 
           photon energies ranging from 10 to 26.5 Mev. In the    G001200100024 
           range from 10 to 19.5 Mev data were collected at 100   G001200100025 
           keV and elsewhere at 200 keV intervals. A total of 10  G001200100026 
           sample-out yield curves was measured. Average yield    G001200100027 
           curves, obtained from the two data sets, allowed the   G001200100028 
           yield curve for the N-15(gamma,xn) reaction being      G001200100029 
           determined by subtraction.                             G001200100030 
CORRECTION the resulting net yield curve was corrected for photon-G001200100031 
           monitor response and dead-time effects.                G001200100032 
ANALYSIS   (PLA) the cross section was analyzed using the         G001200100033 
           variable-bin-Penfold-Leiss method. The resulting       G001200100034 
           N-15( gamma,xn) reaction cross section includes the    G001200100035 
           N-15( gamma,n), N-15( gamma,pn) and twice the          G001200100036 
           N-15( gamma,2n) reaction cross sections. The contribu- G001200100037 
           tion of the latter reaction, which was studied earlier G001200100038 
           by measuring the yield of annihilation gammas from the G001200100039 
           induced n-13 positron activity, was subtracted from theG001200100040 
           cross section data.                                    G001200100041
