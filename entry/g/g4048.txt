COMMENT    The bremsstrahlung photons' flux density in the        G4048  1   16 
           target's location was calculated using a computer      G4048  1   17 
           simulation. A computational modelling was performed to G4048  1   18 
           describe the passage of primary electrons of energies  G4048  1   19 
           ranging from 40 to 90 MeV with a 10 MeV step through   G4048  1   20 
           the target assembly model having the parameters, which G4048  1   21 
           correspond to the parameters of the experimental       G4048  1   22 
           target assembly. For computation purposes, a computer  G4048  1   23 
           program KIPT has been developed. The library of the    G4048  1   24 
           GEANT4 classes, version 9.4 were used. The electron    G4048  1   25 
           beam diameter was set to be 10 mm, the electron beam   G4048  1   26 
           distribution was determined using class G4UniformRand. G4048  1   27 
           For the description of physical processes, the low-    G4048  1   28 
           energy electromagnetic process model Livermore was     G4048  1   29 
           used.                                                  G4048  1   30 
           The simulated bremsstrahlung spectrum was convolved    G4048  1   31 
           with the known experimental cross-section for the      G4048  1   32 
           100Mo(g,n)99Mo reaction and with the cross-section,    G4048  1   33 
           obtained using the program TALYS-1.4, with             G4048  1   34 
           the result that the calculated values of 99 Mo         G4048  1   35 
           activity in the check test target were obtained. The   G4048  1   36 
           difference between the measured 99 Mo activity         G4048  1   37 
           value and the simulated result does not exceed 5-8 %.  G4048  1   38 
               Cross-section for the 100Mo(g,n)99Mo reaction was  G4048  1   39

CORRECTION The experimental data on 7Be activity in the C, N, O   G4048  1   48 
           targets were corrected for the 99 Mo yield. In this    G4048  1   49 
           way the errors due to non identical conditions of      G4048  1   50 
           different irradiation sessions were reduced in the     G4048  1   51 
           determination of the cross-section for 7 Be production.G4048  1   52
