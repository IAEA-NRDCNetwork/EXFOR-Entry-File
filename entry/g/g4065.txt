DETECTOR   (PROPC) From 1 to 3 SNMO-5 neutron counters were       G4065  1   12 
           placed in a paraffin tube measuring 73x73x80 cm, with  G4065  1   13 
           a 4x5 cm axial channel for the investigated samples.   G4065  1   14 
           The counters were located 12.8 cm from the channel     G4065  1   15 
           axis. The photoneutrons were registered between the    G4065  1   16 
           betatron pulses, with a delay of 30 microseconds       G4065  1   17 
           following the g-quantum pulse and a registration time  G4065  1   18 
           of 900 microseconds. The efficiency of photoneutron    G4065  1   19 
           registration was determined by several neutron standardG4065  1   20 
           sources (Po-Be), and by measurement of the yield of    G4065  1   21 
           photoneutrons from the copper. The activity of the     G4065  1   22 
           standard neutron source was known accurate to  +- 10%. G4065  1   23 
           (IOCH) The g-quantum flux was measured with a thick-   G4065  1   24
