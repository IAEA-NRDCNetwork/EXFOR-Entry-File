SAMPLE     The natural Pb target is a self supporting foil with   S0085  1   19 
           a thickness of 4.2 mg/cm2.                             S0085  1   20 
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Two PPACs provided the position and timing of   S0085  1   21 
           the incoming beams with a position resolution of 1     S0085  1   22 
           mm. Each PPAC has 80 gold-plated tungsten wires in     S0085  1   23 
           both X and Y directions and a sensitive area of 80x80  S0085  1   24 
           mm2. The position information was then given by the    S0085  1   25 
           time difference between the signals from both ends.    S0085  1   26 
           The distances of PPAC1 and PPAC2 from the target were  S0085  1   27 
           500 mm and 100 mm, respectively.                       S0085  1   28 
           (TELES,SISD,SISD) Two dE-E silicon-detector            S0085  1   29 
           telescopes were used. Each telescope consisted of one  S0085  1   30 
           dE double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with a   S0085  1   31 
           thickness of 150 um and an area of 48x48 mm2, and one  S0085  1   32 
           single silicon detector with a thickness of 1500 um    S0085  1   33 
           and an area of 50x50 mm2. The distances from the       S0085  1   34 
           target center to the center of the DSSDs were 250 and  S0085  1   35 
           120 mm, respectively.                                  S0085  1   36 
FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) The secondary beam was produced by     S0085  1   37 
           the fragmentation of a 54.2 MeV/nucleon 12C primary    S0085  1   38 
           beam, delivered by the Heavy Ion Research Facility of  S0085  1   39 
           Lanzhou (HIRFL), on a 2615 um Be target. The average   S0085  1   40 
           primary beam intensity during the measurements was     S0085  1   41 
           about 300 enA with a 12C charge state, producing 8B    S0085  1   42 
           and 7Be beams of 500 and 5000 particles per second,    S0085  1   43 
           respectively.                                          S0085  1   44 
METHOD     (EDE,TOF) Two dE-E silicon-detector telescopes,        S0085  1   45 
           covering the polar angles 4- 21 degree and 13-38       S0085  1   46 
           degree in the laboratory frame, respectively, were     S0085  1   47 
           used to measure the energy and angle of elastically    S0085  1   48 
           scattered particles. Secondary beam particle           S0085  1   49 
           identification was made using a combination of the     S0085  1   50 
           measured time of flight (TOF) and the magnetic         S0085  1   51 
           rigidity value.                                        S0085  1   52
