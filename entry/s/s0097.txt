INC-SOURCE The 36Ar primary beam was accelerated by HIRFL, the    S009700100018 
           beam energy was 69 MeV/u. The radioactive ion beam     S009700100019 
           was produced by bombarding the primary target Ni(92.3  S009700100020 
           mg/cm2).                                               S009700100021 
SAMPLE     The secondary target was 12C (109.7 mg/cm2).           S009700100022 
DETECTOR   (SCIN) Two plastic scintillation detectors were used   S009700100023 
           to measure the time of flight (TOF).                   S009700100024 
           (SIBAR) DE detector was a Au-Si surface barrier        S009700100025 
           semiconductor detector before the target. After the    S009700100026 
           target, there were 5 Au-Si surface barrier             S009700100027 
           semiconductor detectors, the thickness of 5 detectors  S009700100028 
           were 150, 150, 700, 700 and 2000 um, the resolution    S009700100029 
           less than 1.8%.                                        S009700100030 
METHOD     (TOF,EDE,TRN) The particles were identified by the     S009700100031 
           TOF and dE before target. After target, the outgoing   S009700100032 
           particles were identified by the dE-E method.          S009700100033

ANALYSIS   The beam energies of 17F, 18F, 19F, 20F and 21F at     S009700100035 
           the centre of the 12C target are ranged from 16 to 33  S009700100036 
           MeV/u. The measured cross sections were transformed    S009700100037 
           into the values at 30 MeV/u by Shen's                  S009700100038 
           parameterization. The change due to this               S009700100039 
           transformation is within 5%.                           S009700100040
