SAMPLE     A 186W target with average thickness of 200 ug/cm2     S027200100014 
           was evaporated on a 50 ug/cm2 of carbon, and covered   S027200100015 
           with a 10 ug/cm2 of carbon layer.                      S027200100016 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The evaporated residues (ERs) yielded in the   S027200100017 
           fusion evaporation reaction 40Ar+186W were filtrated   S027200100018 
           by the Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and Nuclear        S027200100019 
           Structure (SHANS).                                     S027200100020 
           (PS,SISD,SI,MWPC) The ERs were implanted into three    S027200100021 
           300 um thick position-sensitive strip detectors (PSSDs)S027200100022 
           with each active area of 50 X 50 mm2. Eight additional S027200100023 
           non-position-sensitive side silicon detectors (SSDs)   S027200100024 
           were mounted upstream. The total detection efficiency  S027200100025 
           for the emitted alpha was measured to be about 72%.    S027200100026 
           To distinguish the alpha events from the implanting    S027200100027 
           events, two multi-wire proportional counters (MWPCs)   S027200100028 
           were mounted 15 cm and 25 cm upstream from the PSSDs.  S027200100029 
           Three extra non-position-sensitive silicon detectors,  S027200100030 
           featuring the same size as the PSSDs, were installed   S027200100031 
           side by side after the PSSDs to provide the veto       S027200100032 
           signals from the light particles passing through       S027200100033 
           the PSSDs.                                             S027200100034

           two High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors and one     S027200100036 
           clover detector were mounted at the right side,        S027200100037 
           downward, and downstream, respectively.                S027200100038
