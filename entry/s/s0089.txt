INC-SOURCE The 3He+ beam was produced and selected by a 90 deg    S008900100010 
           bending magnet, and then passed through a rectangular  S008900100011 
           aperture, which defined a beam spot area of 2 mm x 5   S008900100012 
           mm at normal incidence.                                S008900100013 
SAMPLE     The deuterium target is a thin layer of amorphous      S008900100014 
           deuterated hydrocarbon (a-C:D) deposited on top of     S008900100015 
           optically flat Si<111> plate prepared by radio         S008900100016 
           frequency discharge from CD4 at Max-Planck-Insitut     S008900100017 
           fur Plasmaphysik (IPP Garching). The amount of D was   S008900100018 
           determined by nuclear reaction analysis at the         S008900100019 
           Garching tandem accelerator. D density of this sample  S008900100020 
           is 1.4E18 D/cm2 with a D/C ratio of 0.64 and the       S008900100021 
           uncertainty is about 5%.                               S008900100022 
DETECTOR   (SIBAR) Two Au-Si surface barrier detectors            S008900100023 
           positioned in the cylindrical experimental chamber     S008900100024 
           for detecting projectile protons and Rutherford        S008900100025 
           backscattering (RBS) 3He particles, the vacuum in      S008900100026 
           chamber was kept in 1.0E-3 Pa. Protons were detected   S008900100027 
           at a laboratory angle of 135 deg, the depletion depth  S008900100028 
           of the detector is 2000 um for completely stopping     S008900100029 
           high energy protons. RBS 3He ions were detected at an  S008900100030 
           angle of 153 deg. Both the solid angles of two         S008900100031 
           detectors were determined based on the mechanical      S008900100032 
           distances. The solid angle of the nuclear reaction     S008900100033 
           analysis detector is 8.5E-3 sr with an uncertainty of  S008900100034 
           2.7% and the solid angle of the RBS detector is        S008900100035 
           5.0E-3 sr with an uncertainty of 2.0%.                 S008900100036 
METHOD     The samples were mounted in a rotatable octahedral     S008900100037 
           copper target and the distances between target center  S008900100038 
           and two detectors both were 77.1 mm. In order to       S008900100039 
           limit the solid angle and reduce the geometry          S008900100040 
           straggling, a parabolic slit with a width of 3 mm and  S008900100041 
           height of 17 mm was put in front of the detector. A    S008900100042 
           50 um thick mylar foil was also used to prevent        S008900100043 
           backscattering 3He and 4He produced by nuclear         S008900100044 
           reaction from entering the window. To reduce the       S008900100045 
           effect of dead time and pile-up on backscattering      S008900100046 
           signal, a 3 mm x 10 mm parabolic slit was mounted      S008900100047 
           ahead of the RBS detector.                             S008900100048 
ANALYSIS   (NTRTH) Rutherford backscattering and nuclear          S008900100049 
           reaction signals were registered on two multi-channel  S008900100050 
           analyzers simultaneously. A program named SIMNRA was   S008900100051 
           used to analyze and simulate recorded spectra. Since   S008900100052 
           backscattering of 3He from Si is Rutherford until      S008900100053 
           3.875 MeV, incident 3He dose was determined by         S008900100054 
           simulating the height of the front edge of Si signal   S008900100055 
           in RBS spectrum.                                       S008900100056
