INC-SOURCE A proton beam was accelerated to energies ranging      S023100100013 
           from 1.4 MeV to 2.8 MeV with a typical intensity of 5  S023100100014 
           uA and with a beam-spot diameter of 4 mm.              S023100100015 
SAMPLE     (32-GE-74,ENR=0.998) The 99.8% enriched 74Ge was       S023100100016 
           evaporated and deposited onto an air-cooled Ta disk    S023100100017 
           with the thickness of 300 um. The diameter and         S023100100018 
           thickness were 18.6 mm and 295+-16 ug/cm2,             S023100100019 
           respectively. The target and its backing of Ta was     S023100100020 
           placed at the end of the beam pipe, also served to     S023100100021 
           seal the vacuum. The beam pipe with a length of 400    S023100100022 
           mm and an inner diameter of 18 mm was electrically     S023100100023 
           isolated from the rest of the beam line for            S023100100024 
           monitoring the beam intensity. A pure Ta disk with     S023100100025 
           the thickness of 300 um was used to evaluate the       S023100100026 
           in-beam background.                                    S023100100027 
METHOD     (BCINT) The escape probability for secondary           S023100100028 
           electrons is approximately 0.013% by assuming an       S023100100029 
           isotropic emission.                                    S023100100030 
DETECTOR   (HPGE) The HPGe detectors were positioned 8 cm away    S023100100031 
           from the target and their angles were 12, 108, 210     S023100100032 
           and 302 deg to the beam axis respectively. The         S023100100033 
           absolute efficiencies of these four detectors at the   S023100100034 
           lower energies were calibrated using a standard 152Eu  S023100100035 
           source, while the efficiencies at the higher energies  S023100100036 
           were calibrated using the 27Al(p,g)28Si reaction at    S023100100037 
           Ep = 992 keV.                                          S023100100038 
ANALYSIS   For each beam energy in the experiment, 36             S023100100039 
           gamma-transitions to the g.s. were observed at each    S023100100040 
           angle. More than 1008 peaks were analyzed to           S023100100041 
           determine the total cross sections of the              S023100100042 
           74Ge(p,g)75As reaction for seven different proton      S023100100043 
           energies.                                              S023100100044 
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) The total uncertainties result from the        S023100100045 
           statistical and the systematic errors.                 S023100100046

           uncertainties from the target thickness, the           S023100100049
