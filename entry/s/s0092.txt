INC-SOURCE A secondary beam of 11Be was produced from a primary   S009200100016 
            beam of 13C bombarding on a 456 mg/cm2 Be target.     S009200100017 
            Beam intensity and purity of 11Be were up to 10000    S009200100018 
            particles per second (pps) and 95%, respectively.     S009200100019 
SAMPLE     A polythene (CH2)n target with thickness of 4.0+-0.05  S009200100020 
            mg/cm2, while a 12.58+-0.10 mg/cm2 thick carbon       S009200100021 
            target was employed to subtract the background from   S009200100022 
            carbon atoms in the (CH2)n target.                    S009200100023 
DETECTOR   (PPAC,SCIN) Two parallel plate avalanche counters      S009200100024 
            with a tracking efficiency of about 90% were          S009200100025 
            installed upstream of a plastic scintillator, to      S009200100026 
            provide energy loss and time-of-flight (TOF)          S009200100027 
            information to identify the incoming particles.       S009200100028 
           (TELES,SISD,SI) The telescope TELE0, to detect 10Be    S009200100029 
            from 11Be(p,d)10Be transfer reaction, comprised of a  S009200100030 
            double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with       S009200100031 
            thickness of 1000 um and two large surface silicon    S009200100032 
            detectors (SSDs) with thickness of 1500 um, was       S009200100033 
            centered at the beam line with a distance of 200 mm   S009200100034 
            away from the target and covered an angular scope of  S009200100035 
            0-10 deg in the laboratory frame.                     S009200100036 
           (TELES,SISD,SI,CSICR) The telescope TELE2, to detect   S009200100037 
            d from 11Be(p,d)10Be transfer reaction, was placed    S009200100038 
            235 mm away from the target with central angle of 25  S009200100039 
            deg relative to the beam line, composed of a          S009200100040 
            65-um-thick SSD, a 300-um-thick DSSD, a 1500-um-thick S009200100041 
            SSD and a layer of four CsI(Tl) crystals. Each        S009200100042 
            crystal has an active area of 4.0x4.0 cm2 and a       S009200100043 
            length of 4.1 cm.                                     S009200100044 
           All the SSDs and DSSDs have an active area of          S009200100045 
            62.5x62.5 mm2. The width of each DSSD strip is 2 mm,  S009200100046 
            bringing in an angular resolution of less than 0.6 degS009200100047 
            for the detection of 10Be and deuterons. The energy   S009200100048 
            resolution for all the silicon detectors was less     S009200100049 
            than 1% for the 5.486 MeV alpha particle.             S009200100050
