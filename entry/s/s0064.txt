SAMPLE     An silicon detector (1000 um in thickness), which      S006400100015 
           serves as both  the reaction sample and the dE         S006400100016 
           detector.                                              S006400100017

INC-SOURCE The typical beam intensity was about 20 nA on the      S006400100026 
           production target of Be with 3123 um in thickness      S006400100027 
           which was installed at the entrance of RIBLL. 12N      S006400100028 
           was produced by the projectile fragmentation process.  S006400100029
