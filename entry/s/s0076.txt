FACILITY   (PRJFS,3CPRIMP) Experiment was performed at the        S007600100018 
           Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou(RIBLL).           S007600100019 
           The typical intensity of the 7Be secondary beam was    S007600100020 
           5E3 particles per second with a primary beam intensity S007600100021 
           of 300 enA. The secondary beams were identified by     S007600100022 
           combining the measured TOF and magnetic rigidity value.S007600100023 
           The radioactive nuclear beams of 7Be, together with    S007600100024 
           the contaminants of 9C, 8B and 6Li ions, were produced S007600100025 
           by the fragmentation of a 54.2 MeV/u 12C primary beam  S007600100026 
           bombarding a 2615 um thick Be target located at the    S007600100027 
           first focal point of RIBLL.                            S007600100028 
SAMPLE     The target used was a self supporting foil of natural  S007600100029 
           Pb with a thickness of 4.2 mg/cm2. The target had the  S007600100030 
           following isotopic composition: 208Pb 52.3%,           S007600100031 
           207Pb 22.6%, 206Pb 23.6% and 204Pb 1.48%.              S007600100032 
DETECTOR   (PPAC) Each PPAC consists of two anodes and one        S007600100033 
           cathode. The cathode plane in the middle of detector   S007600100034 
           is a 2 um thick Mylar foil coated with a thin          S007600100035 
           Au-layer on both sides. The two anode planes are       S007600100036 
           located symmetrically on both side of the cathode and  S007600100037 
           consisted of gold-plated tungsten wires. The wires,    S007600100038 
           50 um in diameter, are spaced by 1 mm pitch. There are S007600100039 
           80 wires in both X and Y directions and therefore the  S007600100040 
           sensitive area is 80*80 mm2.                           S007600100041 
           (SCIN) Two 50 mm thick plastic scintillation detectors S007600100042 
           were used to measure TOF.                              S007600100043 
           (TELES,SISD,SI)The scattered particles were detected   S007600100044 
           by SI DeltaE-E telescopes (denoted as DeltaE-E1 and    S007600100045 
           DeltaE-E2 in Fig.3). Each telescope consists of one    S007600100046 
           double-sided silicon strip DE detector(DSSD) of 150    S007600100047 
           mm in thickness and 48*48 mm2 in area, and one single  S007600100048 
           silicon detector (SSD) of 1500 mm in thickness and     S007600100049 
           50*50 mm2 in area.                                     S007600100050 
           PPAC and scintillation detectors were used for         S007600100051 
           detection of incident 7Be, while the TELES were used   S007600100052 
           for detection of outgoing particle.                    S007600100053 
METHOD     (TOF) The secondary beams were identified by combining S007600100054 
                 the measured TOF and magnetic rigidity value.    S007600100055 
           (EDE) The scattered particles were identified by EDE   S007600100056 
                 telescopes.                                      S007600100057
