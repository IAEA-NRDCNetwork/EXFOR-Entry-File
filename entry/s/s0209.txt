INC-SOURCE The 40Ar ions were accelerated to an energy of 201     S020900100021 
           MeV with a typical intensity of 500 pnA.               S020900100022 
SAMPLE     (75-RE-185,NAT=0.948) A 185Re target with a thickness  S020900100023 
           of 400 ug/cm2 was prepared by sputtering the material  S020900100024 
           onto a 45 ug/cm2 thick carbon foil, and then covered   S020900100025 
           by a 10 ug/cm2 thick carbon layer.                     S020900100026 
METHOD     A total of 2.1E18 ions were delivered to the target    S020900100027 
           over a period of 189 hours.                            S020900100028 
DETECTOR   (MAGSP) The gas-filled recoil separator SHANS (        S020900100029 
           Spectrometer for Heavy Atoms and Nuclear Structure)    S020900100030 
           was used for the separation of recoiled evaporation    S020900100031 
           residues (ERs) from the primary beam particles and     S020900100032 
           other unwanted reaction products. The transport        S020900100033 
           efficiency of the separator was estimated to be 14%    S020900100034 
           by using the test reaction 40Ar + 175Lu.               S020900100035 
           (PS,SI,MWPC) The ERs were implanted into three         S020900100036 
           position-sensitive 16-strip detectors (PSSDs),         S020900100037 
           which were mounted side by side at the focal plane of  S020900100038 
           the separator. The energy, position, and time of the   S020900100039 
           implantation of the ERs and their subsequent           S020900100040 
           alpha-decay events were measured using these           S020900100041 
           detectors. To detect the alpha particles escaping      S020900100042 
           from the PSSDs, eight side silicon detectors (SSDs)    S020900100043 
           were mounted perpendicular to the surface of PSSDs in  S020900100044 
           an open box geometry. The total detection efficiency   S020900100045 
           of the detector array was measured to be 72%. In       S020900100046 
           order to distinguish the alpha-decay events from the   S020900100047 
           implantation ones, two multiwire proportional          S020900100048 
           counters were mounted upstream from the PSSDs. Behind  S020900100049 
           the PSSDs, three punch-through silicon detectors were  S020900100050 
           mounted for the rejection of signals produced by       S020900100051 
           energetic light particles.                             S020900100052

           Based on the measurement of the correlated alpha-decay S020900200005
