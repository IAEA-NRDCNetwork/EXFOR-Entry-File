DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,CSICR) It is consist of 5 Si-Au and 1 CsI    S008600100021 
           detector. The thickness of 5 Si-Au detectors are 150,  S008600100022 
           150, 150, 2000 and 2000 um. The thickness of CsI is    S008600100023 
           10 mm.                                                 S008600100024

INC-SOURCE The 13C primary beam was accelerated to 75 MeV/u by    S008600100027 
           HIRFL. The typical beam intensity was about 30 nA. It  S008600100028 
           is bombarded with 9Be target of 2 mm in thickness,     S008600100029 
           which produces secondary beams of 8B and 9C.           S008600100030
