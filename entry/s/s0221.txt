FACILITY   (CYCLO,3CPRIMP) External Target Facility (ETF)         S022100100010 
INC-SOURCE (FRAGM) A primary beam of 18O was accelerated to 280   S022100100011 
           MeV/nucleon by the main Cooler Storage Ring (CSRm)     S022100100012 
           synchrotron of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in      S022100100013 
           Lanzhou (HIRFL) and directed onto a Be target of 15 mm S022100100014 
           thickness. The unstable secondary beams produced       S022100100015 
           by fragmentation of 18O were separated using the       S022100100016 
           Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou-II (RIBLL2) and   S022100100017 
           transported to the experimental area where the ETF is  S022100100018 
           located.                                               S022100100019 
SAMPLE     A 900 mg/cm2 thick carbon target.                      S022100100020 
DETECTOR   The acceptance of the ETF detector system for the 15B  S022100100021 
           fragments amounted to about 100%. The detection        S022100100022 
           efficiency of the ETF was calibrated using the         S022100100023 
           various secondary beams, and the derived efficiencies  S022100100024 
           were 80%-90%, depending on the charge number of the    S022100100025 
           beam particles.                                        S022100100026 
           (SCIN,IOCH) The time of flight was measured between    S022100100027 
           two plastic scintillator detectors (SC1 and SC2) and   S022100100028 
           the energy loss was recorded by a multiple sampling    S022100100029 
           ionization chamber (MUSIC1). The time of flight was    S022100100030 
           measured between a plastic scintillator (SC2) and a    S022100100031 
           30-strip plastic scintillator wall (TOFW) placed       S022100100032 
           about 10 m downstream from the target. The energy      S022100100033 
           loss was measured by a multiple sampling ionization    S022100100034 
           chamber (MUSIC2) placed 50 cm downstream of the        S022100100035 
           reaction target.                                       S022100100036 
           (MWDC) Two multiwire drift chambers, located upstream  S022100100037 
           of the carbon target and each having an active area    S022100100038 
           of 13 x 13 cm2, were used to measure the trajectories  S022100100039 
           of the incoming particles. The magnetic rigidity of    S022100100040 
           the outgoing charged fragments passing through the     S022100100041 
           ETF magnet was reconstructed from the positions        S022100100042 
           measured using two MWDCs placed upstream and three     S022100100043 
           MWDCs placed downstream of the magnet. The two MWDCs   S022100100044 
           placed upstream of the magnet have an active area of   S022100100045 
           13 x 13 cm2. Each of the three MWDCs downstream of     S022100100046 
           the magnet has an active area of 80 x 60 cm2.          S022100100047 
METHOD     (TOF,EDE) The secondary cocktail beams, magnetically   S022100100048 
           centered on 16C, were identified using the TOF-dE      S022100100049 
           method.                                                S022100100050 
           (COINC) The trigger of the data acquisition system     S022100100051 
           was generated only by requiring the coincidence of     S022100100052 
           the signals from SC1 and SC2, both in front of the     S022100100053 
           reaction target.                                       S022100100054 
ANALYSIS   To avoid effects arising from reactions on the target  S022100100055 
           frame, the beam-spot size on the target was limited    S022100100056 
           to 4 cm in diameter in the off-line analysis by        S022100100057 
           setting a software gate using the information from     S022100100058 
           the MWDCs. The background contributions were measured  S022100100059 
           by using target-out runs and subtracted.               S022100100060 
ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) The uncertainties are dominated by          S022100100061 
           statistical errors, while systematic errors mainly     S022100100062 
           arise from the correction for the ETF detection        S022100100063 
           efficiency and are added to the statistical            S022100100064 
           uncertainty in quadrature.                             S022100100065
