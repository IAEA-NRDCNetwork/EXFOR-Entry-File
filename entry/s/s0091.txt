DETECTOR   (HPGE) The activity of the irradiated Au foils were    S009100100016 
           measured by a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector.   S009100100017 
           The relative efficiency and energy resolution of the   S009100100018 
           detector were 65% and 1.90 keV at 1.33 MeV,            S009100100019 
           respectively. The absolute efficiency was calibrated   S009100100020 
           with the standard sources 60Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, and      S009100100021 
           152Eu.                                                 S009100100022 
           (IOCH) An air ionization chamber was placed in front   S009100100023 
           of the target to determine the beam intensity.         S009100100024 
METHOD     Water-bath activation-foil method.                     S009100100025 
           (ACTIV) The irradiation continued for 22 h to obtain   S009100100026 
           sufficient beam fluence. The average carbon beam       S009100100027 
           intensity was 1.15E7 pps.                              S009100100028 
           (GSPEC) The activity for each Au foil was determined   S009100100029 
           by measuring the peak intensities of the               S009100100030 
           characteristic gamma ray with energy of 412 keV from   S009100100031
